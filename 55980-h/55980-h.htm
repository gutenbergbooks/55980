<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The publishing of these simple notes is due to
the wishes of one who is now no more. But
for this they would probably have never seen
the light, and I feel therefore that less apology
is needed for their crudeness and ‘diariness’
than would otherwise have been the case.</p>

<h1>WITH SACK AND STOCK IN ALASKA</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">LONDON TO SITKA</span></h2>

<p>On the twenty-fifth of April, 1888, I was playing
golf on our little links at home, and had driven
off for the Stile Hole, situated on the lawn-tennis
ground, when I observed the butler emerge from
the house with an orange envelope in his hand,
and come towards me across the lawn. Having
with due deliberation played a neat approach
shot over the railings on to the green, I climbed
over after it, putted out the hole, and then went to
meet him. The telegram proved to be from my
friend Harold T., with whom at Saas in the
previous summer I had discussed Seton-Karr’s
book on Alaska, and we had both come to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
conclusion that we should much like to go there.
Finding that I should have the summer of ’88 at
my disposal, I had written to him at the end of
March to ask about his plans and now got this
telegram in reply. It was sent from Victoria, B.C.,
and was an urgent appeal to join him and his
brother at once, as they meant to make an attempt
on Mount St. Elias that summer, and must start
northward by the end of May. I retired to the
smoking-room to consider the situation, and finally
came to the conclusion that such a hurried departure
might be managed.</p>

<p>I crossed over to Brussels, where I was then
posted, packed up all my goods and chattels, left
masses of P.P.C. cards, and returned again three
days later. The afternoon of May 11 found me
on board the Allan liner ‘Polynesian’ at Liverpool.
I was fortunate in making some very
charming acquaintances among the few saloon
passengers on board, and though the good ship
did not bely her sobriquet of ‘Roly-poly,’ we had
a very pleasant crossing till the 17th, when
we got into a horrible cold wet fog, the temperature
on deck not rising above 34° for two days,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
while for about twelve hours we ran along the
edge of, and occasionally through, thin field-ice,
all broken into very small pieces. About noon
on the 18th we sighted land to the north, covered
with snow, and entered the Gulf of St. Lawrence
next day. We stopped off Rimouski to pick up our
pilot at lunch-time on Whit-Sunday, a lovely day
but very cold, and having left summer in England,
we seemed to have returned suddenly into winter.
Next morning we awoke to find ourselves at
Quebec.</p>

<p>As we had brought nine hundred emigrants,
and the ‘Oregon’ and ‘Carthaginian’ came in at
the same time, there was a mob of over two
thousand despairing passengers at the landing-stage
station hunting wildly for their luggage.
I abandoned the conflict and went round the
town, calling at the Post Office, in hopes of
hearing something from H., but there was nothing,
which was not very wonderful, as, though I had
telegraphed to say I was coming, I had not
indicated my route in any way. So I returned
and collected my things, and after a successful
interview with the Customs officials got the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
greater part of them checked to Vancouver, and
conveyed the remainder to the railway station,
where I found my friends of the voyage. There
was a train to Montreal at half-past one, but it
was very crowded, and we fell victims to the
blandishments of a parlour-car conductor, who
represented to us that his car would be attached
to the emigrant special which would leave at
three o’clock and reach Montreal as soon, if not
sooner, than the ordinary train, as it would run
right through. We fell into the snare, deposited
our properties in the car, and went off into the
town again, returning punctually at three. Alas
there was no sign of the emigrant train, and it did
not leave till six, while its progress even then was
of the most contemptible character, stopping for
long periods at benighted little stations, so that we
did not reach Montreal till three in the morning.
Fortunately we had furnished ourselves with
biscuits, potted meat, etc., including whisky, and
so did not actually starve, but we were all very
cross, the ladies especially; and though the train
was going to continue its weird journey we declined
to have anything more to do with it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
hurried up to the big hotel, where we were soon
wrapped in dreamless slumbers, which lasted so
long that we very nearly came under the operation
of a stern rule which decreed that no breakfasts
should be served after half-past ten.</p>

<p>After seeing as much of the city as we could
during the day, we had an excellent dinner, drove
down in plenty of time to catch the 8.30 Pacific
train, and ensconced ourselves in the recesses of a
most admirable sleeping-car, the name of which
was, I fancy, the ‘Sydney.’ The C.P.R. berths
are most comfortable, and so wide that in many
cases two people are willing to share one, but the
greater part of dressing and undressing has to be
done inside the berth, as in all Pullmans, which is
inconvenient till you get used to it. In this
respect the gentlemen are better off than the
ladies, as we were able to make use of the
smoking-room which was next our lavatories,
while I fancy the ladies’ accommodation was
much more circumscribed.</p>

<p>The next day was very hot, and was spent in
running past little lakes and through marshy
forest, called ‘muskeg’ or peat land. Early in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the morning we picked up an excellent dining-car
in which we breakfasted, lunched, and dined most
luxuriously, the intervals of the day being occupied
with whist, tobacco, and light literature. On the
following morning we found ourselves skirting the
northern edge of Lake Superior, enjoying superb
scenery as the line followed the curves of the rock-bound
shore. That day we had the best dining-car
of the whole trip, which unfortunately was
taken off after lunch, and we had to content
ourselves with high tea at Savanne; but a far
greater disaster awaited us next morning, for, on
inquiring for our breakfast at a fairly early hour,
we heard that an ill-mannered goods train had run
into it in the night as it was peaceably waiting for
us, and had reduced it to a heap of disintegrated
fragments. This was a pretty state of things, but
I had been warned beforehand that such calamities
were sometimes to be met with, and so our party
were prepared. Setting up an Etna inside a
biscuit-tin so as to guard against the possibility of
disaster from the jolting of the carriage, we
brewed our tea, and made a comfortable meal off
biscuits, potted meat, sardines, and marmalade,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
while the rest of the passengers, who seemed to
have neglected these precautions, glared upon us
in hungry envy. However, we reached Winnipeg
at noon, and they rushed in a tumultuous body to
the refreshment-room. Here we overtook that
ghastly train in which we had started from
Quebec, and some waifs and strays were recovered
which the ladies had left behind. At Portage-la-Prairie
a dining-car was attached, and we were
enabled to get our evening meal in peace. Next
morning, Saturday, we secured our travelling
restaurant at a place called Moosejaw about six
o’clock—at least I was told so.</p>

<p>And here I wish to protest against the insane
habit of early rising which seems to possess the
passengers on the C.P.R. I am an early riser
myself, in fact I pique myself on it, but in this
car I was always the last, with the exception of
one of my friends, a young Englishman ranching
at Calgary. By seven o’clock the Babel of
voices, and the noise made by our coloured attendant
as he stowed away the beds, compelled
one to get up, which was unkind if one had
been talking and smoking till 1 or 2 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
could, however, always get a nap in the smoking-room.</p>

<p>That day we had a quite shocking dining-car,
so bad that I hereby publish its name, which
was ‘Sandringham,’ in the hope that the Cuisinal
Director of the C.P.R, whoever he may be, will
have taken care to reform that car before I next
meet with it.</p>

<p>As our Calgary friend got off the train at
2 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>, some of us sat up till that hour to see him
off, but we turned out again at four o’clock to
enjoy the grand scenery of the Rockies, into the
heart of which we crept, up the Bow River, over
the Kicking-Horse Pass, down to Donald, and then
we crossed the Columbia, and began to climb up
the valley of the Beaver into the Selkirk range.
This is even finer than the Rockies, owing to the
greater size of the snowfields and glaciers, and the
view from Glacier House, where we stopped for
lunch, the grades in the mountains being too steep
to allow of a dining-car being attached, was
magnificent in the extreme. At this point the
great Illecillewaet glacier descends into the valley,
backed by the superb spire of Mount Sir Donald,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and the C.P.R. have most obligingly built a
summer track outside the snow-sheds to enable the
passengers to see it in comfort. It was on this
day that we crossed the trestle bridge in the
Beaver Valley, 295 feet above the stream below;
two of us happened to be sitting at the time on the
step of the car, and as the bridge, which has no
parapet or floor of any kind, is curved, we were
tipped forward till we could contemplate the water
far beneath between our feet as they overhung the
edge of the step. We held on rather tight during
the minute or so spent in creeping over it. This sitting
on the step of the platform was most enjoyable,
as there had been rain in the night, and consequently
there was no dust, but every now and then the one
who was sitting farthest from the projecting roof
of the carriage received an icy shower-bath, as the
train dashed suddenly into a snow-shed through
the roof of which the melting snow was dripping,
and little feminine squeals might be heard, intermixed
with deeper bass grumblings.</p>

<p>At Glacier House I received a letter from H.,
saying they could not start for another fortnight,
and recommending me to stop off there for a day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
or two and go up the glacier; but, as all my
climbing things were in my checked baggage, I
preferred to go on. We were detained an hour or
so by a disobliging boulder which had playfully
rolled down on to the track and had to be removed
with dynamite before we could proceed, and then
we went down over some marvellous loops, which
resembled the twistings of the St. Gothard near
Wasen, crossed the Columbia again, and climbed
up into the Gold Range. From Revelstoke to
Sicamous we were accompanied by a dining-car,
but our dinner would, perhaps, have been more
satisfactory, though more devoid of interest, had
they not selected the moment at which we were
running fast down a steep incline to jam the brakes
on. Away went every wine-glass, soup hopped
out of the plates, potatoes out of the dishes, and
we might as well have been in a rough sea with no
fiddles on. At last peace, and as much of the
dinner as could be collected, were restored. Late
in the evening we enjoyed a most lovely view over
the broad smooth expanse of Lake Shusroap, the
train running along its reedy shore for some time.</p>

<p>During the night we careered down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Thompson, and found ourselves at daybreak accompanying
the Fraser in its wild career to the
sea. We were compelled to breakfast at North
Bend, at the objectionable hour of seven, and my
toilet was hurried in a very undue manner; but
the views all that morning were ample compensation
for having been dragged out of bed.</p>

<p>All this time I had no conception of where H.
was, his letter having said nothing, but in London
I had been given an address in the town of
Vancouver, and so had determined to go there first.
Being a Monday, no boat ran to Victoria from
Vancouver, and so I had to part with my friends
and nearly all the other passengers at Westminster
Junction, whence they went on to New Westminster.
I reached Vancouver at two o’clock, and
after securing comfortable, not to say luxurious,
quarters in the brand-new C.P.R. hotel, strolled
down to find out about H., and discovered that he
and his brother were located at the famous Driard
Hotel in Victoria.</p>

<p>The afternoon was spent in wandering about
the town, the evening in smoking at the house of
an hospitable fellow-countryman, and the next day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the little steamer ‘Yosemite’ conveyed me across
the blue waters of the Gulf of Georgia, muddied in
one place by the flood of the Fraser, to Victoria, a
distance of about seventy miles. We had an
exciting race with the old Cunarder ‘Abyssinia,’
now employed in the mail-service between Canada
and Japan. She moved first from her moorings in
Burrard Islet, but her head was lying the wrong
way, and before she got round we were out of the
harbour with a quarter of a mile’s start. Down
the long straight piece that followed she gained
slowly but steadily, and was almost level with us
on our left when we just succeeded in getting into
Plumper’s Pass first, and in the intricate windings
of this tortuous channel, where the ship kept
spinning round in little over her own length, we
again got a long start which was gradually reduced
till there was nothing of it left as we neared the
south-east point of Vancouver Island; but here
we cut inside a group of small islands, where apparently
the larger vessel could not come, and this
time we gained such an advantage that we were not
again caught. We steamed round the corner into
the very beautiful harbour of Victoria, and reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the wharf at half-past eight. Here I was met by
H., apprised by telegraph of my approach, and
really hardly recognised him without his moustache,
which for some obscure reason he had
chosen to shave off while staying at the Glacier
House in the spring. Having entrusted my
baggage to an express man, we did not go up at
once to the Driard, as it was too late to procure
dinner, or indeed anything else to eat there, but
repaired to the Poodle Dog, where my hunger was
at last appeased. We then proceeded to the hotel,
where we found E., H.’s brother, and most unlike
him, and talked over plans far into the night. A
fourth man, W., an American member of the A.C.,
was coming to join us, but the taking of his degree
was delaying him. Still he did his best for us by
sending us long telegrams of advice every day.</p>

<p>The next few days passed rapidly, the mornings
being spent in shopping, though that was a
task which fell chiefly to H., who had been elected
‘boss’ of the party, or in frantic endeavours to
ascertain how we were going to get from Sitka to
Yakutat, a distance of nearly three hundred miles.
We entered into negotiations with the owners of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
two steam-schooners, but as one asked fifty dollars
a day and the other four thousand for the whole
trip, we rejected these noble offers. The afternoons
were spent by E. and me in sailing on the harbour
in ‘plungers,’ stiff little Una-rigged cutters,
which revealed the meaning of their name if there
was any sea on, or in lawn-tennis in the gardens
of various hospitable magnates of Victoria. At
the house of one of these I encountered an old
friend, a neighbour at home, whose ship was now
on the station, and I had the pleasure of dining
with him on board at Esquimault the next
evening.</p>

<p>There was great uncertainty even about the
arrival of the ‘Ancon,’ the steamer which was to
take us up to Sitka; she was expected to arrive
early on the 4th of June, but did not turn up till
the evening of the 5th, crammed with American
tourists. With the utmost difficulty we obtained
a fairly airy but exceedingly diminutive cabin, for
at first we found ourselves condemned to a pocket
edition of the Black Hole. H. tried to make us
believe that the majesty of his presence had over-awed
the purser, but we somehow fancied that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
bribery and corruption had something to do with
it. In consequence of this mob of passengers
there were three breakfasts, three lunches, etc., a
most horrible arrangement, while at all of them
the food was bad, and the waiting worse. Thus
we grumbled, little thinking with what enthusiasm
the same cookery would be received on our return.</p>

<p>As a sea voyage this trip up to Sitka is quite
unique, though possibly travelling among the
fiords of Norway might be compared to it in
quality if not in quantity, for these steamers travel
about eight hundred miles between Victoria and
Sitka, only about thirty miles of which, the
crossing of Queen Charlotte’s Sound, can in any
sense be termed open sea, though the whole of it
is on salt water. The whole coast up to Cape
Spencer is fringed with a mass of islands separated
by deep and very narrow channels, in some instances
so narrow that, as in the case of Peril
Straits and Seymour Narrows, even a steamer can
only pass them at slack water. One American
gentleman assured me that in the latter strait the
tide had been known to run seventeen knots! All
these islands are densely wooded with conifers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
among which may every now and then be detected
the white streak of a waterfall racing down
the steep hill-side.</p>

<p>We stopped to coal at Nanaimo, and while
this objectionable process was going on, H. and I
spent the afternoon in drifting about the harbour
in an Indian canoe, a dug-out about twelve feet
long, managed in just the same way as the
Canadian canoes we have in England, and in
endeavouring to acquire some Chinook, the jargon
invented more or less by the old traders, and used
all over British Columbia and the southern part of
Alaska. It contains chiefly Indian words, most of
which are common to various different tribes, a
few English, a few Russian, and a good many
French words, such as Siwash (i.e. <i>sauvage</i>) for
Indian, and <i>sawmon</i> for any kind of fish.</p>

<p>Then for six days it rained at intervals, while
a grey pall of cloud stretched ceaselessly over our
heads, and we spent most of our time playing
whist or euchre in our cabin, which would just
hold four people. Our fourth on these occasions
was a most cheerful Scotchman, known to us as
the King of Cassiar, to which kingdom he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
now returning. He possessed a large stock of
most excellent whisky when he came on board.
During these sad and gloomy days we visited
sundry salmon canneries, and about midnight on
Sunday the 10th we arrived at Wrangel. We had
now got so far north that there was quite light
enough even at that hour to walk about the
streets, and I accompanied our Scotch friend
ashore, as he was to leave us here and go up the
Stickheen river. While in the town I gleaned the
information that canoes went up almost every
summer from Hooniah to Yakutat along the unprotected
part of the coast, and we proceeded to
sketch out plans for conveying our expedition in
the same way.</p>

<p>The next day was still wet and cold, and
though we met sundry small icebergs floating
down from the glaciers in Taku Inlet, we saw
nothing of the mountains which gave them birth.
Some excitement was caused by our stopping
about eleven o’clock to pick up a fair-sized canoe
with four of Mr. Duncan’s Metlakatla Indians in
her, who had encountered rough weather and
damaged their frail craft. We reached the mining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
city (!) of Juneau in the evening, and H. and I
plunged about till late at night, seeking, with the
assistance of Mr. Reed, a Juneau store-keeper, for
some sloop or schooner which might convey us up
to Yakutat. This we failed to find, but we
engaged a certain Dick as interpreter, who was
said to be the smartest Indian in Alaska, and
rejoiced in the appellation of the Dude. For this
aristocratic Siwash’s services we weakly consented
to pay four dollars a day and his food, and he
accompanied us on board, his luggage being about
as voluminous as that of a Swiss guide.</p>

<p>On Tuesday the 12th we had at last a perfectly
beautiful day, during which we steamed
from Douglas Island, the seat of the biggest gold-mine
in Alaska, up the Lynn Canal to Pyramid
Harbour. The mountains on each side of the
narrow inlet were covered with glaciers, all
obviously shrinking, and none of any great size,
till we came to the Davidson Glacier, close to
Pyramid Harbour, which at a distance appears to
come right into the sea, though it is really
separated from it by a narrow belt of moraine.
Retracing our course next day down the Lynn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Canal, we then went down Chatham Strait to
Killisnoo, where I saw the biggest salmon that I
ever came across in Alaska, a brace of about fifty
pounds each, and then, passing through most
beautiful scenery in Peril Straits, finally reached
Sitka at 11 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span></p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">SITKA TO YAKUTAT</span></h2>

<p>As we were detained at Sitka for a fortnight,
making preparations for the expedition, and
waiting for W. to come up on the next boat, I
may as well give some description of one of the
most beautiful places I have ever seen. As the
traveller lands on the pier, he has the Indian
village of about five hundred inhabitants on his
left, while just in front are the barracks of the
United States marines, and the old Russian
citadel, from the top of which he will obtain a
lovely view, somewhat resembling that of the Bay
of Naples, but with the additional charm of the
snow mountains and small glaciers at the head
of Silver Bay. Numbers of small green islands
stretch across its mouth, while further away to the
west lies Kruzoff Island, humping itself into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
dormant volcano of Mount Edgcumbe and the
double summit of the Camelsback. Due east, and
almost overshadowing the town, rises the sharp
peak of Verstovia, so called by the Russians from
its being supposed to be exactly a <i>verst</i> (about
three thousand feet) high, but the translation of
the Indian name is Arrowhead. To the north-east
lies the little pool of Swan Lake, above which the
forest-clad hills sweep up again to the height of
about two thousand feet, while across the bay to
the south rise mountains of very respectable proportions.</p>

<p>As he goes on up the main street, our traveller
sees on the left a broad grassy <i>place</i> beyond which
are the remains of towers and stockades, now no
longer required to keep out the hostile Siwash,
while on the right are a row of stores, of which
one or two are still the old log buildings erected
by the first inhabitants. He then passes the
simple but hospitable little Baranoff hotel on his
left, and finds himself in front of the Greek
Church, the main feature of Sitka. Brilliantly
though rather tawdrily decorated inside, its
service on Sunday was impressively conducted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and was well attended by many of the older
Indians, and by the few Russians left in Sitka.</p>

<p>The road continues along the shores of the
bay to the Indian River, a broad rapid stream,
foaming in places over ledges of rock; the ground
in its neighbourhood has been reserved as a sort
of public park, and, though wild and uncared for,
presents pictures of great beauty. But though
beautiful, the town is very diminutive, and its
permanent white population does not, I should
think, amount to more than one hundred souls.
We had a letter of introduction to Mr. Vanderbilt,
one of the Sitka merchants, and, after securing
rooms at the aforesaid hotel, went to interview
him with decidedly satisfactory results. His
partner, Mr. De Groff, was at that time at
Yakutat, where he had established a small store,
and was supervising some gold mining that
had been commenced in the black sand on the
shore. His small schooner, the ‘Alpha,’ was
expected back every day from sealing, and as
soon as she returned she would be sent up to
Yakutat with stores for his partner, and could take
us as passengers. At that time we did not intend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
to take any white men, trusting that we should be
able to get canoes and porters at Yakutat, Dick
being the medium of communication.</p>

<p>We then decided to go on a little training
expedition, and selected a sharp peak we had
noticed from the steamer in approaching Sitka,
and had set down as between seven and eight
thousand feet high. To reach this we departed
one afternoon in a fair-sized canoe with its owner
and Dick, and rowed (for most of these large
canoes are fitted with oars) in a northerly direction
for about six miles, till we reached the mouth of a
narrow bay known as Nusquashinsky or Nushanitzky.
Here the wind, though light, was in our
favour, and we sailed peaceably up it, reaching its
head about seven o’clock, and camped by a broad
stream, along which we had at first thought we
could make our way towards our mountain, which
the Indian informed us was called Sha-klokh, or
Spear-peak, but the bush in the valley was so
dense that we struck straight up next morning,
till in about four hours we got above tree-level,
and pitched camp at a height of about two
thousand feet close to a big bed of snow. Next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
day we climbed our peak triumphantly in about
three hours, and even put on the rope to cross a big
snow-patch hanging on the face, but its height
proved to be only 4,300 feet, so easily is one
deceived at first in a new country. We built a
big stone-man on the top, which we afterwards
found was visible with a glass from the bay, and
returned to the tents, where we spent most of the
afternoon in slumber. At this camp we got one
or two deer, and took a lot of venison back to
Sitka, intending to dry it and take it north, but
unfortunately it all went bad in that moist atmosphere.</p>

<p>Our next expedition was to Kruzoff and
Mount Edgcumbe, and this time we had rather a
sickener. As we had about fifteen miles of much
more open sea we took a bigger canoe, and had to
pull the beastly thing all the way, so landed in the
first place which came handy, a very awkward
landing with a lot of big rocks about. From the
appearance of clouds of mosquitoes in the evening
Dick prophesied bad weather, and he was right, for
it poured the whole of the next day, most of
which we spent in the tent. In the afternoon I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
went out to look for deer, but the bush was so
dense that it was impossible to get through it
silently, and though I just glimpsed a couple as
they started away, I couldn’t even get a snap-shot,
and returned <i>bredouille</i> in a very dripping condition.
The following day the weather was not
quite so adverse, though there was still plenty of
rain, and getting our canoe afloat we rowed for
an hour and a half along the beach, till we reached
a spot where the men said the bush was not so
thick. In this they were right, but the ground
was broken into countless ravines which always
seemed to be at right angles to our course, and
getting up and down the slippery sides of these
with a heavy knapsack on one’s back proved rather
exhausting, so that the afternoon was well advanced
by the time we began to climb the steeper slopes
of Edgcumbe itself. At last we came on a small
clear space in the middle of the thick scrub; and
though no level spot could be found for the tent,
we decided to pitch camp. A lot of cedar boughs
were cut and arranged as evenly as possible for
our bed, and after we had fried with bacon and
disposed of a ptarmigan H. had picked off with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
his rifle as we came up, we made what the Indians
called ‘a white man’s fire,’ and so got warm if not
dry before crawling into our blankets for the night.
On the previous evening we had made a nondescript
meal off cockles and ‘gumboots,’ a large species
of <i>chiton</i> found adhering to the rocks. The
Indians are very fond of these and attribute soporific
powers to them, but I certainly cannot recommend
them, for they resemble nothing more
than the indiarubber after which they are named,
being absolutely tasteless and appallingly tough.</p>

<p>It rained all night, but the Edgington tent
stood it well, very little coming through, and that,
I fancy, only where carelessness had left some
article touching the canvas. With a view to
assisting the commissariat department, we separated
in the morning, E. and H. going up to the
top of Edgcumbe, and securing two more ptarmigan
on the way. They found the bottom of the
shallow crater covered with snow, and on the
summit itself encountered the tracks of one of the
enormous Alaska brown bears (<i>Ursus Richardsonii</i>).
I took Dick towards the Camelsback, but we
never saw a sign of deer or bear, and so about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
two o’clock I turned to come home, giving him
the rifle that he might make a last effort to procure
venison. I had no doubt about being able
to find my way back, for I had taken my bearings
carefully, and a fair-sized dead tree standing in
the middle of our small clearing afforded a capital
landmark. I went at a fair pace, and though all
the ravines were very much alike, I presently felt
pretty sure I was nearing camp, an opinion confirmed
in a minute or two by hearing, as I thought,
the crooning song of the Indian we had left behind.
Still no dead tree appeared, and thinking I must
have been mistaken, I pushed on for another
quarter of an hour, by which time I felt sure I had
gone far enough. I struggled up the mountain, I
scrambled down, I shouted and yelled, I had an
exciting chase after a couple of ptarmigan, one of
which I managed to bag with my revolver, but
nowhere could I see this mangy tree, and began
to feel very unhappy, as it was gradually borne in
on me that I was very decidedly lost. At last
I saw far below me two tiny lakes which we had
passed on the previous day, and decided to go
down to them, as I felt pretty sure I could make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
camp from there. Hardly had I descended a
hundred yards, when I came into the corner of
a clearing, and heard E.’s voice. And then the
mystery was explained; the other Indian, with
praiseworthy but most mistaken industry, had cut
down the dead tree for firewood. It had rained all
day, and in the night a tremendous south-west
gale came on which proved the last straw, and we
settled to return to Sitka, where we were going to
dismiss the Dude, with whom we had had a row. He
had accidentally left his blankets on the beach by
the canoe, and though we had lent him one of ours,
he was very dissatisfied, and apparently coming
to the conclusion that serving us was not likely to
be all beer and skittles, announced that he was not
coming to Yakutat. We made no attempt to get
him to change his mind, for we had already come
to the conclusion that he had much too good an
opinion of himself, and was more than a little
lazy, though he was an entertaining conversationalist,
and gave us interesting scraps of information,
either social, such as the number of slaves
he had till quite recently possessed, or geographical,
such as that twenty-one miles up the Copper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
River a glacier stretches across its whole width, a
phenomenon which existed on the Stickheen till
comparatively lately. He added that the river
was two miles wide at this point, and that a
portage of fifteen miles across the ice was made
by the Indians with skin canoes, or bidarkies, but
as he had never been there I am inclined to doubt
his details. Although we were unanimous as to
the expediency of dismissing him, we were not
at all so united as to how he was to be replaced,
and became, indeed, a little despondent as to
whether we should get further than Yakutat, so
that had we been able to communicate by telegraph
with W., I am not at all sure that the
expedition would not have then and there come
to an end, and the members of it taken refuge in
the Selkirks. Luckily we had to wait for him, and
in the interval more cheerful counsels prevailed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we packed down again to the
canoe; the wind was very high and there was a
lot of sea, but the men thought that as the wind
was fair we might venture, and after lunch off a
confiding grouse which had fallen a victim to E.’s
rifle, we started, and found that, whether we liked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
it or not, we had got to go on, as returning to the
island in the teeth of the gale was quite impossible.
The rollers were enormous, but with a
little scrap of sail we flew along finely, and in
about two hours were back in Sitka harbour.</p>

<p>The next few days were spent chiefly in endless
confabulations with various white men and
Indians who were willing to accompany us as
porters, which resulted in the engagement of two
white men, Lyons and McConnahay, and four
Sitka Indians, the former to receive three, the
latter two dollars a day and their food. E. and I
occupied ourselves one morning in the ascent of
Verstovia. We left at four o’clock along the
Indian River by a fair trail for about an hour, and
then, crossing the stream by a fallen tree, struck
up to the right through the most abominable bush,
full of devil’s clubs, an exceedingly evil plant with
large green leaves and scarlet berries, covered as
to the stem and the backs of the leaves with
minute prickles which penetrate the human skin
with unpleasant facility, and, if left in, cause festering
sores. It was steamingly hot in the low
ground, but we struggled up somehow, or rather I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
did the struggling, for E. appeared provokingly
cool while I was dripping and breathless, and
eventually reached the top of the sharp rocky
cone which forms the highest peak, at half-past
seven, getting just scrambling enough in the last
hundred feet to find our rifles rather a nuisance.
As we had been told we should take at least six
hours, we were rather pleased with ourselves, and
after spending an hour on the top and setting up
a flagstaff left there some years before by a party
of marines, we descended leisurely by the west
face, instead of the north-west ridge up which we
had come, and got back to Sitka just after eleven.</p>

<p>At last the ‘Alpha’ returned from sealing with
119 skins on board and was beached for repairs.
She was followed next day by the ‘Elder,’ which
brought W., and after two or three days’ packing
and arranging, we actually started on Tuesday,
July 3, at 10.30 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> About half of the slender
population of Sitka came down to see us off,
and to wish us every success. While the little
five-and-twenty-ton schooner was beating out
between the islands against the fresh north-west
breeze we discovered that we were being pursued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and soon afterwards a boat came up, bringing an
American flag, provided by the kindness of Mr.
Hayden, the Acting Governor, and we accordingly
hoisted the Stars and Stripes at the masthead.
Mrs. Hayden had previously presented us with a
small silk flag to be left on the summit of Mount
St. Elias, if we ever got there. Dinner was soon
announced and we proceeded below, but recoiled
from the fearful heat and smell, caused by the
want of ventilation in the cabin in which was the
cooking-stove. E., who was proof against anything,
remained below, but H., W., and I retired
to the deck, where we ate our meals during the
greater part of our voyage. Shortly afterwards
we three yielded to the gruesome attacks of seasickness,
as the little vessel was now pitching
freely; W., who had often cruised off the east
coast of the United States in small yachts, soon
recovered, but H. and I remained more or less
prostrate the whole time we were on board.</p>

<p>The wind was dead ahead, west by north
(magnetic), and our craft made so much leeway
that our onward progress was insignificant. Next
morning, under a grey sky, we were only fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
miles from Sitka; Edgcumbe was still in sight the
morning after that; and it was not till Friday the
6th that we sighted Mounts Fairweather and
Crillon, some sixty miles off, and right ahead.
Next day we were only about twenty miles from
them, and went tacking steadily up the coast, the
glories of which were veiled in almost constant
rain and cloud, without making much progress.</p>

<p>On Sunday we at last got past Lituya Bay,
near which we saw a humming-bird. In the
evening, the wind, which we now regarded as a
personal enemy, since, blowing from the north-west,
it ought at least to have brought fine weather,
began to die away, and at about two in the morning
a vigorous south-easter sprang up, so that we
flew along finely in the right direction at last;
but, to our intense disgust, Captain Jimmy, whose
only fault was over-caution, perhaps a natural one
on these very dangerous coasts, hove to, fearing
lest we might be driven ashore in the thick
weather that prevailed. In the evening the wind
collapsed and we got a glimpse of land, as to the
identity of which there arose a considerable argument,
but on the whole those who had been there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
before held the opinion that we were about thirty
miles from Ocean Cape, which view proved correct,
as next morning, which was more or less fine, we
were only ten miles off. Mount St. Elias and the
range as far east as Mount Vancouver were visible,
but swathed in clouds. Their height did not
impress us much at first sight, but we were greatly
struck with the enormous mass of the Malaspina
Glacier, the white upper part of which presented
such a curiously regular appearance that at first
we believed it to be a layer of cloud, till undeceived
by the telescope. There was hardly any wind, but
we crept round Cape Phipps at last, and came in
sight of Yakutat. Once round the corner, the
light breeze from the west sent us along faster,
and we were soon abreast of the ‘ranche’ on
Kantag Island. Great was the excitement
among our men: ‘There’s De Groff,’—‘and
Callsen,’—‘and Dalton.’</p>

<p>We had hoisted our flag, but the halliards got
entangled and the Stars and Stripes were an unsightly
ball, omen perhaps of what was to befall
us, for as we rounded the point at the end of the
island, we kept a little too far out, the tide, ebbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
swiftly through the narrow channel, caught our
bows, and we ran hard and fast on to a rocky
shoal instead of sailing into the harbour known as
Port Mulgrave. We were evidently a fixture till
the tide rose again, and so went ashore in the
hope of finding strawberries, in which we were
disappointed, as, though there were any number of
plants, the Indian women and children had been
beforehand with us, and we only collected a meagre
half-dozen. We made the acquaintance of Mr.
De Groff, Vanderbilt’s partner, and so part-owner
of the ‘Alpha,’ a short, rather good-looking man,
with blue eyes and fair hair and beard. Our
Siwashes soon found friends and relations in the
village, and we agreed to pay them board wages
at the rate of $1.25 per day for the lot, while
McConnahay (‘Shorty’) and Lyons were to feed
with us on the ‘Alpha.’ Another little schooner,
the ‘Three Brothers,’ of Kayak Island, was in the
harbour when we arrived, but took her departure
next day.</p>

<p>There being some alarm as to whether the
water would not come in and damage our stores
when the schooner floated, we at first resolved to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
sit up, but eventually we gave it up and turned in.
About midnight she was got off and beached in
front of the ranche without our knowing anything
about it, and without taking in any water.</p>

<p>From this point onwards I give the events just
as they are noted in my diary.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">OPENING APPROACHES</span></h2>

<p><i>Wednesday, the 11th.</i>—H. spent a large part of
the day in interviewing the chief, ‘Billy Masterman,’
on the subject of canoes and men. We also
engaged two white men who, with several others,
had come prospecting up the coast from Juneau
in a whale-boat, but had done no good and were
anxious to return in the ‘Alpha.’ ‘Ed.’—I never
knew his other name—was tall and dark; Finn,
commonly called the Doctor, was a smaller, red-haired
man. Both seemed rather slight for packing,
but had the reputation of being good cooks.
As they were repairing the schooner, we pitched
the green tent on the beach, and H., W., and I slept
in it, E., who had a slight cold, preferring to
remain on board.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, the 12th.</i>—We managed to engage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
two large canoes, one of which was to wait at
Icy Bay for us. Its owner agreed to this on
the condition that he was to stay with it, and
with him a youth who was said to be his son, but
who subsequently proved to be his brother. Crews
were also secured, and we were to have started at
three, but there was some wind and they declined
to go. W. and I went off and bathed, and then
wandered a little way along the beach after a small
variety of plover, of which we had seen a good
many the day before, but now they all seemed to
have vanished. As we returned, however, we came
on a small flock; ‘Dick,’ De Groff’s setter pup,
spoilt the shot by chasing them, but I got four,
and he made some amends by fetching them out
of the sea. This outer shore of Kantag Island
is a regular shingle beach exposed to the surf; H.
and I went along it the day before for about a mile
to De Groff’s and Callsen’s gold claim, where they
were washing the black sand, or, as some call it,
the ruby sand from the quantity of garnets in it, in
an amalgamator, but they were doing little more
than would pay their expenses.</p>

<p>In the evening the Indians suddenly announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
their readiness to start, and at nine o’clock we got
off in the two big canoes, and a smaller one which
we had purchased for five dollars from one of the
miners returning to Sitka on the ‘Alpha.’ We
were arranged thus:—In the large canoe we were
to keep at Icy Bay were E. and W., with Ed.,
Lyons, Billy, Jimmy, and three Yakutats; in the
other, H. and I, with Shorty, Matthew, Mike, and
five Yakutats; and in the small one Finn and
two Yakutats. De Groff photographed us from
the beach, and we started, the Indians yelling
wildly, and the two big canoes racing till we were
past the point, when they settled down to a more
sedate stroke. Off Cape Phipps, however, the
weather looked so threatening in the south-east
that we returned ignominiously at half-past ten.
We put up our tent on the sand in front of the
ranche; everything else was left in the canoes
ready for a start, with the sails, etc., stretched over
them to protect them from the rain, which came
down in torrents. In the middle of the night the
tent collapsed at W.’s end, and he had to emerge
in the wet and fasten it again, in much peril from
the Siwash dogs which we heard growling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
indignantly as he disturbed their slumbers in the
search for something solid to which to attach the
rope, while we chuckled inside and congratulated
ourselves that we did not sleep next the door.
In the morning we found the sand beneath
us swarming with maggots bred from the refuse
which the Indians used to cast on the beach;
the warmth of our bodies had presumably brought
them to the surface.</p>

<p><i>Friday, the 13th.</i>—Next day the weather looked
better, and after hiring two more Yakutats, who
were put in the small canoe while Finn was
transferred to ours, we got off again at 11 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>
We rowed round the point, and some little way up
the bay, when we set sail. There was a strong
north-east wind, and the small canoe was soon a
good way behind. About half-past three we were
off Point Manby; things looked rather bad, with
dense black clouds to the south-east, so we waited
for the others to come up, and held a council of
war. Shorty, who was always on the safe side
strongly urged our going ashore, pointing out that
there was no landing between Point Manby and
Icy Bay, a distance of over thirty miles, and that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
should it come on to blow from the south-east, it
would probably be impossible to land through the
surf by the time we reached the latter place; we
should be unable to turn back against the wind,
and our only chance would be to run right on
before it, in which case we should be carried on
to Kayak unless we swamped by the way.
Unwilling as we were to land at Point Manby,
which, if the weather became bad, would involve a
detention of unknown length, and would in any
case cause much confusion among our stores by
our having to land, and then re-embark them, H.
and I were inclined to agree with him, but E. and
W. so strongly opposed it, pointing out with
justice that the similar appearance of the evening
before had only resulted in heavy rain, that we
gave way and decided to go on, thereby, as I
believe, running the biggest risk encountered on
the whole expedition. Fortunately the others were
right, the wind died down, causing the men to
take to their oars, and was succeeded by a
deluge of rain, after which the north-east wind
came again and our canoe took the small one
in tow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>All this time we were running along the face
of the Agassiz, or rather the Malaspina, Glacier,
for it is all one field of ice, which here seems quite
motionless, its front covered with gravel and
boulders, among which appear a few sparse bushes.
At last we reached a point which we recognised
as Cape Sitkagi from the delta of flat land which
commenced just beyond, and Gums, one of the
Yakutats who had been with the former expedition,
indicated that we were near our destination.
Going on some five or six miles further we then
prepared to land. From our men’s accounts of
surf-landings and from Seton-Karr’s book, we were
prepared for a fearful struggle with the waves.
Shorty transferred himself to the little canoe, and
they went ashore without apparent difficulty; but
then she was light and small. Then came our
turn, and H. and I went up into the bows with
instructions to jump the moment she touched, and,
should she get broadside on and capsize, to be
careful to jump to sea, so as not to be pounded
between the canoe and the beach. After these
cheerful directions we were a shade nervous as we
contemplated the shore, which we were now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
rapidly approaching, while the others stood ready
to receive us, but as we got closer we came to the
conclusion that the breakers were very small, and
before we touched our contempt for the Pacific
surf in its then condition was complete. We were
now quite close; the Indians paused for a favourable
moment, and then dashed in their paddles
with wild yells. We rode in on the crest of a
wave and were swept up the beach as it broke.
Instantly the others grasped the canoe, and there
ensued a scene of the wildest confusion. Every
man seized the first thing he could lay hold of,
rushed up the beach with it, tossed it down, and
ran back for more, till the canoe was empty, when
we hauled her up a little way and prepared to
receive the others, who were not quite so fortunate,
for, as they touched land, another breaker came in
over their stern but did no damage. The beach
was now strewn with our properties, which were
gradually collected and conveyed beyond the
reach of the highest tide, where we pitched camp
and the canoes were dragged up. It was now nine
o’clock, but quite light, and some of the Indians
went off after seals which had been seen in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
mouth of a small river just to the east of us. A
good deal of firing was heard, and according to
their own account they shot three, but unfortunately
these were all lost in the sea.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, the 14th.</i>—The morning was spent
in sorting and arranging the stores. With the
object of remaining as long as possible in the
vicinity of the mountain, we four agreed to carry
our own properties, so that the men might be free
to carry more food, and soon came to the conclusion
that we must leave our rifles at the beach.
W. and E. tried to take one between them, but left
it at the first cache. We saw a green humming-bird
flashing along the shore, and another had been
observed at Yakutat. In the afternoon we all
sallied forth to explore the neighbourhood; H.
and Ed. went along the beach, which was covered
with bear-tracks, for some four miles to the first
outlet of the river, re-christened by Lieutenant
Schwatka with the euphonious name of Jones, and
Ed. returned considerably impressed with the
walking powers of our gallant captain. E. and
Shorty penetrated with great difficulty for some
distance along the banks of the river, which ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
into the sea close to camp. I took the shot-gun
and started with W. and Lyons along the beach,
but I soon separated from them, and went on the
shore-side of the lagoons, where I hoped to find
duck. In this I was disappointed, but I shot a
large sandpiper and a couple of ring-necked plover.
On the sandhills of the beach were the largest
wild strawberries I ever saw, some fully as big as
a shilling, while the supply was utterly inexhaustible.
It came on to pour in torrents, and we all
returned soaked through, and quite undecided as
to our future route. All that night the rain
descended in a deluge, and, driven by a fierce east
wind, even succeeded in penetrating our excellent
green tent which had stood so well on Mount
Edgcumbe.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, the 15th.</i>—In the morning the men
showed no sign of life, so after a cold breakfast
H. and W. sallied forth to see whether it would be
possible to ‘pack’ up the river by our camp, while
E. and I curled up again in our blankets. About
2 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> the rain began to leave off, and the men
emerged and made a fire. For lunch we fried
some seal-meat, the Indians having been successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
in shooting one the day before. H. and W. returned
dripping at three o’clock, in time to share
our repast, and reported that the bush was too
dense to pack through, so we decided to start
early next morning and follow the same route as
the Schwatka party. In the evening E. announced
the presence of two plover by the river
close to camp, so I executed a stalk through the
sand which brought me within easy shot, but
trying to get both at once, I missed with the first
barrel and only secured one. I then plucked and
cleaned my four birds, and we fried them with
bacon for supper.</p>

<p><i>Monday, the 16th.</i>—Fine at last and some
sunshine! We had a grand view of St. Elias
through the clouds, which gradually cleared off,
and we were able at our leisure to survey the
monarch, who looked most formidable, but we
hoped he would improve on acquaintance.</p>

<p>Though we were up at five, there was so much
to be done that it was not till eight that the procession
began its march along the sandhills. As
it was the first day, the men were not used to their
burdens of from sixty to eighty pounds, and could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
only go about two miles an hour, in addition to
which they stopped to rest every three or four
hundred yards. As some of the Indians seemed
to be overburdened, I went back to H., who had
not yet started, and we hired for the day three of
the other Yakutats. At the site of Schwatka’s
shore camp we picked up a short .44 cartridge
and a piece of sheet-lead. While resting there
I suddenly perceived a bear cantering along the
other side of the lagoon about five hundred yards
off. Shorty, who was carrying his rifle, which was
also left at the first cache, was anxious to go in
pursuit, but H. declined to allow this, as being a
waste of valuable time. Progressing very slowly,
and halting continually to attack the strawberries,
we at length reached the first river at half-past
eleven. Seton-Karr recommends the ascent of
this, but it looked very unpromising and we kept
on. Most of the men stripped more or less to
cross this stream, which was well over our knees
and horribly cold, but as we knew there would be
lots more wading, none of us four took the trouble
of taking off boots or stockings. In an hour more,
across a flat grassy plain with scattered fir-trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
we reached a creek of the main river and halted
for lunch, after which the fun began.</p>

<p>The streams were not deep, being seldom above
our knees, but their beds, and generally the spaces
in between, were of that terrible glacier mud, as
glutinous as quicksands, and through this we
toiled, every now and then skirting the edge of the
forest, where a scanty vegetation of sedge and
marestails gave a little sounder going, and resting
whenever a fallen log or two offered something
substantial to sit on. Presently it began to rain
heavily; Gums pointed out a spot where he declared
Schwatka halted the first day, but this disagreed
with Seton-Karr’s account, and as it was
yet early we pushed on in hope of at least finding
a dry camping-place. In this, although the moraine
of the Agassiz Glacier was now looming near at
hand, we were doomed to be disappointed; and
after two unusually deep and rapid crossings, in
one of which Lyons lost his footing and emerged
in a pitiable plight, though with nothing gone except
his temper, we sought the shelter of the
woods, thoroughly numbed by this ceaseless wading
in ice-water. Such a thing as a flat place was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to be found above the level of the mud, but by
careful search we discovered a spot where the logs
and stones were more or less disguised by the
dense layer of moss, and pitched the tents. With
the aid of a couple of roaring fires and some
excellent pea-soup we restored some warmth to
our shivering limbs, but, as it was still pouring,
dryness was not to be hoped for, and decidedly
weary with the first day’s march, we sought our
blankets. E. and I then discovered the deceitfulness
of the moss; H. and W. were fairly well off,
but at our end of the tent an enormous boulder
projected. With the aid of knapsacks I enlarged
the mountain, so that I was able to doze more or
less on its summit, while E. curled himself in a
ball in the valley at my feet. The mosquitoes
attacked us in myriads, but E. and W. were soon
asleep; H. and I were not so fortunate, and I
never became enough accustomed to the absence
of darkness to sleep well. In the middle of the
night, just as I was dropping off, I was suddenly
aroused by something tickling my neck, and
putting up my hand grasped an enormous beetle.
Flinging it from me, I promptly massacred it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
discovered H. eyeing my movements with mild
astonishment. I explained, and we composed
ourselves to rest again, if not to sleep.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, the 17th.</i>—Next morning we got off
at half-past seven and continued up the river, but
with less wading as we were now next the Agassiz
moraine. At one point, which must have been
very near the site of Schwatka’s first camp, we
halted for about an hour while W. and H. made
an attempt to get up the face of the moraine. In
this they succeeded, but only to find the scrub on
the glacier itself so dense that it would have been
impossible for the packers to penetrate it, and we
pushed on up the bed of the river. Gums soon
announced that there would be no more wading,
to the delight of the men, who put on their boots;
but their joy was turned to wrath when, on
rounding the next corner, we had to plunge in
again. Of course these streams are always
changing their bed, and we found very great
variations in their rise and fall apart from their
natural increase by day and decrease by night.
This was probably to be accounted for by the
periodical closing and bursting of the many glacier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
lakes. At last the river began to contract, and its
bed was now only about a mile wide. On the
other side was the bare ice of the Guyot Glacier,
while we were now driven by the depth of one of
the main streams on to the moraine of the Agassiz
Glacier, where we halted from half-past eleven till
two, while we had lunch, made a cache, and dismissed
our three extra Yakutats, one of whom was
the boy who was to stay at Icy Bay as company
for the canoe-owner.</p>

<p>We were now reduced to our proper quota of
fourteen, and our retainers deserve a somewhat
more elaborate description than they have hitherto
had. Of our four whites, our right-hand man was
Arthur McConnahay, nicknamed Shorty, apparently
on the <i>lucus a non lucendo</i> principle, being
some six feet four inches in height. Very handsome,
with fair hair and blue eyes, he was the ideal
Anglo-Saxon in appearance, and, being extremely
good-natured, he was a great favourite with our
Indians, with whom he would readily share his last
bit of tobacco; but he was an inveterate grumbler,
and often roused H.’s wrath by his ceaseless growls
against the hardships of the way. Though the son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of an Indiana farmer, he had been on the Pacific
coast for some years, and, being captured in one
of the sealers seized in the Behring’s Sea, had been
stranded at Sitka without means to get away. In
May he had been up to Yakutat and back in a
canoe, searching for a lost sloop, the ‘Leola,’ and
the knowledge he thus obtained of the coast proved
subsequently most useful to me. He had, however,
once been shipwrecked near Valparaiso, when he
had a narrow escape of his life, being washed up
insensible, and always had a great distrust of bad
weather at sea.</p>

<p>Harry Lyons, his great friend, though not so
tall, was a man of immense strength, with light
hair and grey eyes. He hailed from Iowa, and had
been for some time a fisherman on the Columbia
river, where he seemed to have had some rather
exciting experiences, and to have made things exciting
for other people too; for, when one of the
steamers was running through his salmon-nets,
he put a bullet into the bridge within a foot of the
captain. He once got in one haul seven hundred
and fourteen salmon, each over twenty pounds, and
also captured the biggest salmon ever taken in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
river, weighing over seventy-four pounds. Having
lost boat and nets in a storm he had gone in for
sealing, and when we engaged him had just come
in on the ‘Alpha.’ A good packer, and a first-rate
man in a boat, he was terribly lazy in camp, not
wilfully, but it didn’t seem to occur to him to do
things.</p>

<p>Ed. and Finn were both Eastern men, the
former coming from Maine, and the latter from
Erie. Neither was conspicuous for ardour in packing,
and it would have been pretty safe to bet on
their loads being lighter than other people’s. But
in camp they were very useful, especially as bakers.
Ed. generally undertook this task, and it was not
till we were back in Yakutat, and the baking-powder
began to run short, that we discovered
Finn’s talent for ‘sour-dough’ bread. He was a
man of considerable education and of a scientific
turn of mind, with some knowledge of chemistry
and botany. With Ed. and three or four others,
he had come prospecting up the coast from Juneau,
stopping every few miles. They had been up in
Disenchantment Bay, a long fiord running inland
from the head of Yakutat Bay, and were going on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
to Nuchuk, but a few miles west of Point Manby
they were imprisoned on the beach by a storm
from the south-east. Trying to get off too soon,
they were swamped, and barely escaped with their
lives. Luckily for them their boat was not injured,
and when they got off a day or two later, they
returned to Yakutat, as they had lost most of their
stores, and there we found them.</p>

<p>Of our Indians, Matthew, our so-called interpreter,
was not popular with us. He had been a
mission boy, and accordingly thought a good deal
of himself, and was inclined to be insolent.</p>

<p>Mike, a short burly fellow, with a most ruffianly
cast of countenance, was in reality very good-natured,
and, like all the Indians, a magnificent
packer; but he was very slow and somewhat dense.</p>

<p>Billy, who had been specially recommended to
us by Milmore, steward to Captain Newell of the
‘Pinta,’ was my favourite among them. Taller
than usual, and not at all deformed in the legs, he
had almost a European cast of countenance.</p>

<p>Jimmy was just the contrary, being very small
and ugly, with much-distorted lower limbs. Both
he and Billy were extremely strong, and on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
occasion of my return from Camp I to Camp J
their loads came very near a hundred pounds.</p>

<p>Of the two Yakutats who accompanied us,
‘Gums’ was quite a character. He had been so
christened by Schwatka, from his peculiar smile,
which revealed not only his teeth, but the whole
of the interior of his mouth. He was the incarnation
of undisciplined devilry. Full of pluck, he
would rather wade a glacier stream twice over than
go a hundred yards round, as we often found to
our cost when he was professing to guide us up the
river. If we declined to follow the route he selected,
or if he thought his burden too great, he would get
very sulky, not to say wrathful; but, like a child,
he was easily appeased.</p>

<p>Of the other one, George (not to be confounded
with the second chief of Yakutat), I recall but
little, except that on our return he set the fashion
of wearing knickerbockers in the village by rolling
his trousers up to his knees, after the manner
of the Swiss guides. The extreme brilliancy of
his striped stockings impressed this fact on my
memory.</p>

<p>After leaving the cache we went on up stream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
for about a mile, sometimes on little strips of beach,
but oftener driven by the river on to the face of the
moraine, which was covered with dense alder scrub,
offering terrible difficulty to the laden packers, as
the boughs, pressed down by the winter’s snow,
mostly sloped down-hill, while the foothold on the
slope itself was of a most precarious character.
Eventually we left the river and steered to the
east, hoping to get through to bare ice, but the
bush seemed to grow thicker and the ubiquitous
devil’s clubs more numerous at every step. At
last, as we were resting, thoroughly sick of creeping
and crawling through the tangle, W. valiantly
climbed a somewhat stouter alder than usual, and
from that eminence, which threatened momentarily
to collapse with him, announced, to our intense
delight, that he could see bare rocks only a few
hundred yards ahead.</p>

<p>Summoning up our last energies, we soon
pushed through, and as it was now half-past four,
E. and I, who were ahead, began to search at once
for a convenient spot for camp. Although on a
glacier, water was the great desideratum, for the
ice was here completely covered with rocks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
gravel, but I was fortunate enough to discover a
tiny stream by its sound in a convenient hollow,
and set to work, with E.’s assistance, to level a
place for the tent, while H. and W. pushed on a
little way to get some idea of our route for the next
day. It had been discovered that our bacon
was fading away too rapidly, so we confined ourselves
to soup and bread for supper, after which
the sun came out and held out hopes of improvement
in the weather. My watch now caused me
some annoyance by stopping twice, and though it
went spasmodically for about a week, it then gave
out altogether.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, the 18th.</i>—Our luxurious couch of
alder-boughs did not manage to keep the cold out,
so that we did not sleep very well, and obeyed
with alacrity H.’s réveille at five o’clock. It was
a glorious morning and we were off by seven, in a
northerly direction at first, but the going was so
bad that we went back westwards to the depression
where the two glaciers joined. This Agassiz
Glacier, on which it was our miserable fate to
meander so much, to the great detriment of our
boots and our tempers, was covered with the worst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
kind of moraine I have ever encountered, not
excepting the streets of the city of San Francisco.
At first sight it appeared to consist of mounds of
stones, but appearances were, as usual, deceitful;
for these mounds were in reality of ice, produced
by the effect of weathering, and covered with a
skin of rocks and dirt, which was thick on the north,
but thin and often altogether absent on the south
side. Plenty of mud lay in the hollows between,
varied by an occasional ‘moulin,’ and we were
rarely able to travel twenty yards in a straight
line. In the depression it was at first a little
better, but soon after our lunch of bread and
smoked salmon it got much worse, so that frequently
E. and I, who were in front, had to cut a
few steps, and in one of these places Gums came
a most splendid cropper.</p>

<p>At length we left this and steered east again,
being much cheered by reaching a comparatively
flat region, and soon afterwards clear ice. We had
had a grand view of our mountain all day, but it
was still too far off for us to make out any possible
route. On the white ice we progressed much
more rapidly, though it was anything but level,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
being weathered into hummocks three or four feet
high. There were not many crevasses, and those
only a few inches in width. By four o’clock we
were not more than two miles from the Chaix
Hills, which we could see were well wooded on
their lower slopes, but we were steering for a
break in them some seven or eight miles off,
where we hoped might lie the glacier reported by
Professor Libbey as coming direct from St. Elias.
But the men were thoroughly exhausted, and it
was evidently impossible to get there that night,
so we held a council. H., wisely as it afterwards
proved, was in favour of sleeping where we were
on the glacier, and continuing our route next day;
but the rest of us opposed this frigid course with
such warmth, that he reluctantly gave way, and we
accordingly turned north-west to gain the hills, and
soon got into difficulties again among the stony
mounds; while, when H. and I at last reached the
edge of the glacier, we found ice-cliffs, varying in
height from fifty to a hundred feet, utterly cutting
us off from the land. However, I thought I saw a
possible place half-a-mile or so further up, and
going on with great difficulty, I discovered a spot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
where the cliffs gave way to a steep slope covered
with débris, down which we wound our weary way,
and then waded the inevitable river which always
sent us wet to bed. On the other side we found a
charming camping-place on a sort of raised beach,
marking, presumably, the height of the river in some
former flood, but now covered with flowers, among
which I recognised a large blue lupin, mimulus,
two kinds of spiræa, and three of willow-herb.
Mosquitoes were also abundant. After supper we
held a consultation and decided to keep Billy and
Jimmy with us while the rest of the men were to
return to the beach for another load, and in the
meantime we would coast along the east side of the
Chaix Hills.</p>

<span class="smaller">AN ATTACK AND A COUNTERMARCH</span></h2>

<p><i>Thursday, the 19th.</i>—We spent a comfortable
night and indulged next morning in the luxury of
a ‘long lie.’ About nine o’clock the men departed,
going down stream along the edge of the hills.
This was in opposition to our advice, as we felt
sure the ice-cliffs would get worse as they approached
Lake Castani; but Gums confidently
asserted his capability of finding a route, and they
thought anything would be better than repeating
the toils of the previous day. They would, we
reckoned, take two days to go down and three to
return, so that, allowing them a day’s rest at the
beach, we might hope to see them again on
Tuesday. After their departure we reckoned up
our stores; there was not much bacon, but plenty
of soup, chocolate, etc., and flour enough for at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
least a fortnight. We then heated water in the big
kettle and indulged in the luxury of a good wash,
which was perhaps slightly needed, as our scanty
ablutions for the last week had been perforce in
glacier water, which at a temperature of 32° or so,
has not much cleansing power.</p>

<p>After lunch (bread and chocolate) we took
about twenty and the men about forty pounds each,
and set out to make a cache further up the stream;
H., in addition to his burden, attempted to carry
the coal-oil stove, a most detestable fardel, but
dropped it when he had gone about half a mile.
For the first three miles our going was fairly easy,
along the landward side of the stream, but we then
came to a glacier lake, where we surprised a small
flock of geese, at which H. and I fired our revolvers
unavailingly. We at first attempted the land side
of the lake, but were soon defeated, as the cliffs
went sheer down into the water, and we had to
return, wade the stream, and climb up on to
the débris-covered glacier. Half an hour of this
sufficed to bring us to the other side of the lake,
and we descended again to the river-bed, up which
we proceeded for another three miles, wading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
frequently from side to side so as to make the most
of the little bits of beach. Here the hill-side was
very steep and with the ice-cliffs of the glacier
formed a miniature cañon just beyond which we
deposited our burdens on a flat bed of gravel
and returned rapidly to camp, wading the river
twelve times between the cache and the lake.
While we were making the cache, E. went on a
little way and found that the river issued from an
ice-arch under the glacier, from which we hoped
that Libbey’s glacier might be near at hand. We
discovered on our homeward route that it was
possible to pass along the lake under the glacier,
and so to save both time and exertion, though at
the risk of a falling stone or two.</p>

<p>We decided that evening to move camp as far
as the lake before attempting further exploration.
Just after supper, Billy, who had wandered off a
little way down stream, rushed back shouting,
‘Coonch, coonch!’ and explained by saying, ‘All
same dog.’ We ran out with our pistols, but were
only in time to see a large wolf vanish into the
bushes.</p>

<p><i>Friday, the 20th</i>.—We struck camp at 7.15,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and I started first with the men. Before going far
I came on the discarded stove, and managed to
hoist it along; but for this I received no thanks,
as the others wasted a quarter of an hour in vainly
searching for it. Dropping our loads at the point
where the stream issued from the lake, Billy, Jimmy,
and I went back for a fresh lot, and buried a
letter for Shorty, directing them to follow us up
stream. As E. had a cold, it was thought he had
better not do any wading, and he remained in
camp to pitch the tent and arrange things generally,
while H. and W. went on to explore beyond our
cache. After lunch the Indians went back for the
last load, while I tried to get round the lake on the
land side, but I found the rock so dangerous that
I abandoned the attempt. I am no geologist, but
it appeared to be a sort of clayey sandstone, very
hard below, but with a soft crust on top, which
gave way beneath hands, feet, or ice-axe. I then
went round the lake on the ice side, and tried to
cross what seemed to be a peninsula between the
river and the head of the lake; but the ferns and
alder-scrub on this proved to be so dense that after
going some way without being able to see anything,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
I gave that up also, and returned to camp at half-past
three. H. and W. came in at five o’clock,
having got as far as a second lake, whence they
were able to see the glacier that descends from
St. Elias. Though this was still at some distance,
we felt encouraged, and after supper indulged in a
little whist. W. and E. played against H. and me;
W.’s whist was indeed extraordinary, and he apparently
so confused his partner as eventually to make
him revoke in the most palpable manner by trumping
clubs and then leading them. We never played
whist again, but confined ourselves to piquet.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, the 21st.</i>—A cloudless morning
greeted us, and at 7.30 we four started out with
the firm determination of reaching the long-sought
glacier. We went up the river to the ice-arch,
where we climbed again on to the glacier to turn
the second lake. When we had gone a little
further, we halted to sketch and photograph our
mountain, the upper part of which was showing
well over the Chaix Hills. We then plodded on
over the disgusting moraine, and at noon reached
the point where Libbey’s Glacier runs into the
Agassiz. We halted here for lunch, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
started to climb it. Though descending at a considerable
angle, it was not much broken, and in
fifty minutes more E., W., and I, slanting across it
in an easterly direction, reached a green island
which so much resembled the Gletscher Alp at
Saas Fee that we christened it the Langenfluh.
On the other side of this there was a grand ice-fall
with great black seracs. H. had stayed behind to
take some bearings, and at first we failed to see
him anywhere, but soon discovered that he was
taking a more direct course up the glacier towards
St. Elias. We pushed on, and soon joined him on
the plateau above. Here, though a little later the
ice would doubtless be bare, we found some snow-patches
in the hollows, and had to be a little
cautious about crevasses.</p>

<p>Fairly on the top at last, we halted before one
of the most magnificent views I ever hope to see.
The plateau stretched before us, at much the same
level for eight or ten miles, right to the foot of the
mountain, which here rose in one appalling precipice.
Put the Dom as seen from Saas on the top
of Monte Rosa as seen from Macugnaga, and you
will have some idea of the grandeur of the spectacle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
that lay before us. To the right rose the double-headed
Cook, seamed with a great couloir down
its centre, then the rather shapeless mass of Vancouver,
and beyond that numbers of unnamed
peaks, some of which we thought we recognised as
having been noticed at Yakutat. Far away to the
east were Fairweather and Crillon, clearly defined
on the horizon.</p>

<p>The upper part of our mountain was not so
steep as the lower, but the whole face was streaming
with avalanches, the dull boom of which was
plainly audible from time to time, and on the
mountain itself no possible route could be discovered.
On the south arête rises a very prominent
and beautiful peak (subsequently christened
Haydon Peak), and beneath this were some rocks
on which W. urged that an attempt might be made,
but through the big telescope they looked most
unpleasant, and he yielded to our united advice
that we should return on our tracks, and, circumnavigating
the Chaix Hills, which, from their
broken nature, it was impossible to cross, see what
we could do on the south-west side, where Seton-Karr
had failed. After taking observations, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
afterwards gave the height we had reached as 1,625
feet above the sea, we reluctantly left at about
four o’clock, and tried to improve our return route
by keeping down the bed of the stream, instead of
on the ice, till nearly at the second lake; but I do
not think we gained much, as we were then forced
on to the glacier in its most unpleasant part. We
stopped at the cache to bring back some stores,
and finally reached camp at nine, very weary and
footsore from the fearful moraine-walking, which
had nearly destroyed one of my two pairs of boots
already. Some tomato soup revived us somewhat,
and we turned in at half past eleven.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, the 22nd.</i>—The weather was again
perfect, and we spent the morning in sketching
and similar peaceful occupations, but H. was not
going to allow us the luxury of a whole day’s rest,
and after lunch we packed down again to Camp D,
whence E. and I went on down stream, following
the tracks made by our men on Thursday, which
were plainly visible in the sandy soil. In forty
minutes we reached Lake Castani, which presented
an extraordinary scene; the water was very low,
and enormous bergs lay stranded far up the hill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
even to the very edge of the timber, some of them
as much as a hundred feet above the level of the
lake. We were here much puzzled by the sudden
disappearance of the tracks at the water’s edge.
The ice-cliffs were, as we had expected, utterly
unscaleable, and we could only suppose that they
had gone round, their footprints being invisible on
the harder face of the hill.</p>

<p>We continued along the shore till we had
crossed a small stream running in from the north,
and kept on to the west for some distance, when
we realised that the lake was in shape something
between a broad arrow and a crescent moon, and
that our best route in future would be to cut across
from horn to horn. Accordingly, we turned inland
through the trees, and in fifteen minutes reached a
beautifully clear little rivulet, near which were
many flat places well suited for a camp. Stepping
out briskly, eighty minutes brought us back to
camp at six o’clock, where we found the others
preparing supper.</p>

<p><i>Monday, the 23rd.</i>—We actually succeeded in
getting off at 6.45, no light task, as it generally
took a good two hours to make breakfast, including<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
bread-baking, strike the tents, and arrange the
packs. We coasted round the lake and dropped
our loads, not on the stream where E. and I had
been the day before, but by a small pond to the
left, where we could see across Castani to the
glaciers. The Indians then returned to D for
more things, while H., E., and W. started with the
hope of finding a way across the hills at our back.
I had no belief in the possibility of this, and went
on round the lake to try and find out, if possible,
what had been the route of our other men. At
the westernmost point of the peninsula projecting
into the lake, I came on their traces for a few
yards, when they again vanished at the water’s
edge. Oddly enough, the true solution never once
occurred to us. Going leisurely, I reached at
11.15 the north-west extremity of the lake, putting
up half-a-dozen geese as I went whose wildness
argued considerable knowledge of man. I then
meditated a return to camp, but my plans were
suddenly changed by coming on tracks in the
herbage which I believed to be those of the men.
I followed them, first over a space where the wind
had overthrown all the trees in every direction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
raising a natural abattis that presented most
formidable obstacles, and then through some dense
alder-scrub to the edge of the Guyot Glacier.</p>

<p>I supposed they must have gone back by this,
and, as there was no objectionable river cutting
me off, I thought I might as well go on to the
glacier for a bit and ascertain its nature. A belt
of moraine separated me from the white ice, and
this moraine was different to that on the Agassiz.
The glacier was much more even and the stones
fewer, but in the hollows between the mounds lay
pools of horrible red mud often knee-deep, which
made the way anything but a primrose path, for
the mud was often crusted enough to bear biggish
stones, and so deluded the unwary traveller on to
it. At length I got beyond this, making a slight
sketch <i>en route</i>, and, going up parallel with the
hills, found myself on white ice, but involved in a
system of rather formidable crevasses, in one of
which I nearly came to grief. It was at a point
where two large crevasses ran together; I was
between them, and as I reached the apex of the
triangle, from which I intended to jump, the ice
gave way beneath me, and I descended abruptly a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
distance of some seven or eight feet, but the block
wedged beneath me, saving me from a violent
squeeze, if not worse. Though somewhat jarred, I
had not let go of my axe, and chipping a step or
two, was soon out of my prison. A few minutes
more brought me to level ice with very few stones
on it, and as I was able to walk very fast on this,
I had at two o’clock nearly reached the west end
of the Chaix Hills, which here had subsided into
green knolls, though a mile or so further back a
large lake, which with its ramifications and the
gorges from them evidently extended far inland,
must have hopelessly cut off the others had they
tried to cross the hills direct.</p>

<p>I was congratulating myself on my superior
astuteness, when, to my utter amazement, I heard
shots, and discovered the others pursuing ptarmigan
on the hills with their revolvers. By the time
I reached them they had exhausted their few
cartridges, and I found W. anxiously watching
over the old hen, who obligingly waited till I
arrived, but unfortunately I also missed, and we
had no ptarmigan for supper that night. The
others had failed almost at once in their attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
to cross the hills and so had descended to the
glacier, and it was their track I had followed
through the bush. E. was very full of a small
trout which they had discovered in one of the
pools of a tiny rill on the hills, and it was certainly
a complete marvel what that fish could do with
himself in winter, when one would think everything
would be frozen solid. E. went back next
day, captured him and bottled him in alcohol.</p>

<p>On the hills we all scattered; I went across
to the other side and had a grand view of St. Elias
across the curve of the Tyndall Glacier, but
coming back to the Guyot a good deal lower down
than where I had left it, I found I had missed the
others. Being rather tired, I was disinclined to go
back, so kept on homewards, and an hour’s
moraine, and then fifty minutes across the neck of
the peninsula, on which were one or two pools full
of yellow water-lilies, brought me into camp at
six o’clock pretty well beat, but I got two loaves
made and some apples cooked by the time they
arrived an hour later. We then had to pitch our
tent, and it was, as usual, hard to find a flat place,
but we managed it at last, though the flies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and mosquitoes here threatened to be worse than
ever.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, the 24th.</i>—E. and W. went off about
nine to cut a trail through the worst part of the
bush by the Guyot Glacier, and the Indians to E
for the last load of stores. H. and I stayed at
home mending our boots and raiment, much
plagued by the flies, of which there were many
kinds, varying from a large house-fly to a microscopic
grey beast, but all equally anxious to feed
off us. About eleven I went towards the lake and
succeeded in setting fire to a couple of dead trees,
to serve as a signal to the men whom we were expecting
from the beach. After this we lunched
early off a few beans, and then H. set off with
Billy and Jimmy to make a cache at the place
where we left the bush for the Guyot Glacier.
Directly afterwards E. and W. came back, and at
the same moment we heard shouts across the lake.
The men had returned. E. shouted to them to go
round by the Guyot, and I rushed off and caught
up H., who, after the cache had been made, set off
to meet them, while the Indians and I returned
slowly as it was very hot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>As the rest of us were having supper, a little
after six, we suddenly saw a figure come in sight
round the <i>eastern</i> corner of Castani. It was the
energetic Gums, followed at intervals by the rest of
our men, who had failed to understand our cries
and had gone on by the Agassiz Glacier to our old
camp at D. Gums, who had sworn he would
never go that way again, kept his word in the
letter if not in the spirit by cutting steps down the
cliffs some three hundred yards short of the slope
opposite camp, down which the others came as
they had done before. The mystery of their footprints
was then explained. When they reached
the lake its bed was quite dry, and they went right
across it to the western side, where they were able
to get on to the ice, and, the Guyot Glacier proving
much easier than the Agassiz, they reached B
without difficulty the first day. The next day
they reached the shore, going down by the river
recommended by Seton-Karr, which we had
advised them to try. They took a day’s rest,
returned in one day to B, and made their camp
next night at the spot where the river issued from
the ice. Leaving this at 4.30 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>, they had nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
got to Castani by nine o’clock, when Gums, who
was on ahead, reported that the lake was too high
to cross, and they turned towards the old route on
the Agassiz, finding very bad going.</p>

<p>While thus engaged they saw the smoke from
the fire I had lit, and Gums then said he could get
round by the Guyot, but as he had previously
denied the existence of such a way the men
declined to try it, and, after hailing us without
understanding what we said in reply, went on to
D and so round. They were all in good health,
but George, the only one who had no boots, was
very footsore. H. came in about half-an-hour
later, somewhat annoyed by his wild-goose-chase,
splashed with glacier-mud, and hoarse with shouting
after the lost caravan; but he was too hungry
to waste time in grumbling, and after supper we
turned in early. At this camp, in consequence of
E.’s snoring, which had become perfectly maddening,
packed like sardines as we were, I turned
round and slept with my head where my feet used
to be. W. occasionally did a little snoring in a
mild way, but was nothing to E., who not only
snored his breath in, but blew it out again with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
puff like a locomotive. Sleeping with his head
under the blankets because of mosquitoes, increased
the evil, and it was no good my poking or kicking
him, for he always went to sleep again long before
I did.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, the 25th.</i>—After the fatigues of the
previous day the men slept late. Gums went to
fetch some of the Indians’ blankets, &amp;c., left at D.
At nine o’clock E. and nearly all the men got
under way, followed shortly by H. and W., while
an hour later I brought on Mike, George, and
Gums, who went very slowly and did not reach the
edge of the glacier till twelve. Here I had a row
with Gums, who had apparently got out of bed
wrong leg foremost, and maintained that his load
was too heavy, threatening, in order to lighten it,
to throw away the frying-pans and kettles. As he
had been ahead of us most of the time, so that I
had had to call him back more than once, and was,
besides, much the strongest of the three Indians
with me, this was absurd, and I nearly lost my
temper with him, a fatal thing when dealing with
the natives; but, curbing my righteous indignation,
I merely remarked, ‘Halo kettle, halo muck-a-muck,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
<i>i.e.</i>, ‘No kettles, no supper,’ and, leaving
him to digest that information and a ship’s biscuit
to soften it down, I went on after the others, who
were vanishing over the glacier. For this my
conscience rather reproached me afterwards, for,
without amounting to an ice-fall, there were some
rather ugly crevasses a little way on, in which laden
men might conceivably have come to grief, but
they turned up all right. I had caught up most of
those ahead, and had relieved W. of the camera
which he was carrying, when we heard shouts from
E. and Shorty at the edge of the glacier.</p>

<p>With the exception of H., who was on ahead
up the glacier and took no part in the struggle
that ensued, we hurried on and found that, as they
got on to the hill-side, they had espied a small
flock of geese on a pool between the glacier and
the land. Shorty fired his pistol at them, on
which, instead of flying away, they swam into a
cave under the ice, and he ran down and blockaded
them while E. shouted for us. We went down to the
water, and with some difficulty reached the mouth
of the cave on pieces of ice that were more or less
afloat. To get there we had to pass under a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
slender ice-arch that seemed to be on the point of
falling, but once on the ice-blocks we were quite
safe. Accordingly Shorty, W., and I commenced
firing, whilst the others guarded the exit as best
they could, and a wild scene ensued. E. in his
excitement slipped into the water, where he
grabbed no less than three geese, but was only
able to secure one, with which he retired to shore
terribly numbed. Meanwhile a good many had
got out of the cave, but, to our delight, they could
not fly, the old ones being in moult at the time and
the young ones being still flappers, so that, after
much stone-throwing, firing, and occasional use of
ice-axes, we found ourselves in possession of ten
geese. Two, I believe, escaped under the ice,
one badly wounded.</p>

<p>We then pushed on after H., bearing our spoils
with us, and camped about four o’clock in a most
lovely spot at the west end of the Chaix Hills.
Just at our back was a little lake about two
hundred yards long, in which we used to bathe,
and in front of us rose our mountain, partly concealed
by a group of fir-trees to our right, the last
timber that we met with, though I saw three dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
trunks on the other side of the Tyndall Glacier.
We made a tremendous supper off stewed goose
and apple-sauce, and afterwards decided to cross
the glacier next morning to the site of Schwatka’s
last camp, where, though there was no timber, we
could see that there was plenty of scrub, probably
alder, like that surrounding us. There was a most
lovely sunset, but directly afterwards it got very
cold, and we rapidly sought our blankets.</p>

<span class="smaller">FURTHER ADVANCE AND MY RETREAT</span></h2>

<p><i>Thursday, the 26th.</i>—A beautiful sunrise ushered
in a splendid day, and we turned out at four
o’clock. At 5.30 Ed., with Matthew and Mike,
started down to bring up the stores left in the
cache by the Guyot Glacier, and half-an-hour later
the rest of us descended the slopes to the Guyot, as
a long lake cut us off from going directly on to
the Tyndall Glacier. Once on the ice, we curved
round to the north, making for the north-east extremity
of the opposite hills. The glacier was
fairly flat and not much broken, though there were
a good many small crevasses in the white ice as
we approached the hills. All these glaciers are
shrinking so rapidly that crevasses, generally of
considerable size, are always to be found anywhere
near their edges, and as these are naturally nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
always parallel to their direction, they are some
times a great nuisance.</p>

<p>We got on to the green hills at 9.30; Gums
showed us Schwatka’s last camping place, and,
after rummaging about a bit in the bushes, produced
the Niagara crampons brought by Professor
Libbey. The last hill, which rose about two
hundred feet above the glacier, was almost isolated
from the rest, and we pushed on over the low col
between it and the main mass, putting up several
coveys of ptarmigan as we went over the grass
and through patches of alder-scrub. In a few
minutes we came to the glacier again; between it
and the land was another small lake on which were
numerous geese, but we made no attempt at the
time to molest them. Two fair-sized streams ran
into this, and as Gums declared, wrongly as usual,
that we should find no firewood further on, we
halted directly after crossing the first of these.</p>

<p>The men then returned, except Jimmy and
Billy, who were to stay with us as before. Shorty
and Harry were to remain at Camp G, and the
rest to go down to the beach and return in about
ten days, by which time we expected to have done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
our possible, though our hopes of getting to the
top were very faint by this time. As they departed
along the edge of the lake we saw them
waving and pointing, but could not make out what
it was all about. After resting a little, H. and W.
went off to explore, while E. stewed a goose and I
made bread and pitched the tent. Our camp was
on the edge of a low cliff above the stream, and
at the extreme verge of this a bear had been
squatting in the long grass. The Indians utilised
this spot as their camping-place. H. and W. did
not return till half-past eight, decidedly despondent.
They found a relic of Seton-Karr on the
Tyndall Glacier in the shape of an empty tomato-can.
We came to the conclusion that we should
have to go a good deal nearer the foot of the
mountain before establishing a base camp, and
that we must get hold of Lyons and Shorty.</p>

<p><i>Friday, the 27th.</i>—We spent a quiet morning
looking over our stores, and made the painful discovery
that a large portion of the oatmeal biscuits,
which had not before been unpacked, had gone
mouldy, so we spread them in the sun to dry.
Directly after lunch W. went off to sleep at G<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and bring the men back next day, and H. and E.
took the Indians with light loads to the proposed
site for the new camp, the disadvantage of which
was the apparent absence of fuel. I followed up
the course of our camp stream, finding fresh and
large bear-tracks, to a curious cirque. A promising
couloir filled with hard snow presenting itself, I
worked up to a height of perhaps two thousand
feet, when there came a break in my gully. I tried
to turn it, but the rock was of the same rotten
clayey consistency that I had before encountered,
and I had to give it up, so glissaded down my
couloir and returned to camp, where I had got
supper ready by the time the others came back.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, the 28th.</i>—The nights were now very
cold, but the weather continued glorious. The
Indians got off at 7.30, and we followed them in a
few minutes. About a hundred yards beyond our
camp the second stream had cut a deep, precipitous
gully, but we had found a good place to cross this,
just opposite to where a small stream came in on
the other side, and we then followed up this stream,
flushing sundry ptarmigan. There was very little
scrub here, our route lying over what were apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
grassy uplands. In reality there was
little or no grass, the vegetation consisting of
willow-herbs, veratrum, ranunculus, mallow, violas,
and many others, some of which were strange to
us but doubtless common enough in America. I
noticed a scarlet flower which I had seen in abundance
on the Pacific slope of the Canadian Pacific
Railway, which is, I believe, known to botanists as
<i>Castilleja miniata</i>. It is something like a rattle,
but the calyx is scarlet and the real flower green,
or at least it looks as if it was. Just as we were
getting on to the glacier, which has here a slight
outflow from which the stream that we were following
up emerges, we saw a brown bear about
half-a-mile ahead on a green knoll which was
nearly surrounded by ice. E. said, ‘How easily
we could cut that fellow off if we only had our
rifles,’ and we sighed in chorus. A little later we
found that, had we been able to attempt such a
manœuvre, it would only have ended in gnashing
of teeth, for our furry friend on seeing us had gone
straight down on to the glacier, and we now saw
him a mile away, going straight for St. Elias, and
steeplechasing gaily over the intervening crevasses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
We had rather a bad bit of ice here, and in future
the men always went over the hill where his bearship
had been, which was fearfully steep but saved
a good piece.</p>

<p>We then crossed two glaciers coming in from
the west, which were curiously different in appearance.
The first, subsequently christened the
Daisy Glacier, was about a mile wide and six
miles long, beautifully smooth and white, with
hardly a crevasse in it except at its junction with
the Tyndall, at which point it was lower than the
glacier into which it flowed. The other, which we
called the Coal Glacier, was rather smaller, say five
miles long by twelve hundred yards wide, was a
good deal broken, and was covered with débris,
among which we found lots of coal which burnt
fairly well in our camp fire. The mountains
adjacent were sandstone with great seams of coal
plainly visible. The amount of débris on the
surface of the Coal Glacier protected it so much
more from waste than the Daisy Glacier, that its
level was about the same as that of the Tyndall.
On the north side of this we put down our packs,
and the men returned to H for more, with instructions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
to bring up a load of fuel as well. This
proved to be unnecessary, as there was still enough
alder round Camp I to supply us with fire-wood.
H., E., and I then went on up the Tyndall Glacier.
We had gone about a mile, and the others were
some little way ahead, when in jumping a crevasse
the elastic of my snow-spectacles gave way and
one of the glasses got broken. As they were my
only pair and I am hopelessly short-sighted, so
that ordinary ones are no use, here was a fearful
catastrophe! I shouted to the others that I was
going back, and returned shortly to camp. From
previous experience in Switzerland I knew I could
use no makeshift without fearfully delaying the
others. The risk of ophthalmia too, from which I
had once suffered, was not lightly to be risked in
these desert places, and I reluctantly came to the
conclusion that I must abandon all idea of climbing.
It was a fearful nuisance after coming so far,
but was partly attributable to my carelessness in not
bringing two proper pairs, instead of these and a
ramshackle old pair which I found at Sitka to have
come to grief on the journey. This was due to
the haste with which I had had to leave England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
My first idea was to return to the beach so as not
to be wasting the food we had brought up with
so much labour, but no one could be spared
to go down with me, and the others were opposed
to my going alone, so I consented to wait for
them.</p>

<p>I then pitched the tent, to do which I had to
excavate part of the hill and remove a good many
boulders. About six o’clock the shrill whistles of the
marmots, which were very plentiful here, heralded
some one’s approach, and a few minutes later W.
arrived, followed by the four men. H. and E. came
in ten minutes later, having had rather a bad time
among the big crevasses of the Tyndall Glacier,
many of which were more than partly covered
with snow. Shorty said they were waving at the
lake as they went down to point out that the geese
were leaving the water and climbing on to the
moraine, so that we might have cut them off, but
we had not understood.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, the 29th.</i>—A cool grey day with high
clouds, the first break in the brilliant weather
which began on the 21st. The other three, with
Lyons and Shorty, left at 7 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> to make a high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
camp on the other side of the Tyndall Glacier.
They took the big white tent and the Edgington
ground-sheet, with provisions for about four days,
their intention being to try to reach at least the
upper rim of the so-called ‘crater’ on the south
arête. Soon afterwards I took Billy and Jimmy
leisurely down to Camp H for more stores, and,
as Shorty had said, my going round the lake sent
the geese up the moraine. Billy and Jimmy lay
in ambush and succeeded in slaying four with
ice-axes. I got back first to Camp H, lit a fire,
and had to make a damper, as there was no
baking-powder in the sack of flour there. By
making it quite thin it turned out very palatable,
and, after lunching off this and some of the dried
salmon, which was a trifle high by this time, we
set off home again, Billy carrying the hams, fish,
beans, and one goose, Jimmy a box of stores and
medicines and another goose, while I took the
other two. We plucked, singed, and cleaned them
all, and then buried three in the snow on the
glacier. We had the fourth for supper, with an
entrée of <i>foie gras</i> (not very <i>gras</i>) and bacon, and
as I felt lazy I commanded Billy to make the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
bread. The result was so excellent that he
remained chief baker while I was alone, and I
fancy he washed his hands quite as often as I did.</p>

<p>At this camp there were hardly any flies or
mosquitoes, the former of which plagues had been
terrible down at H. After supper the men went
after marmots, but of course without getting
any, and I saw them clambering up and down the
most break-neck-looking places behind the camp.
They showed no distaste for ice, but they were
never on snow, and we never had occasion to use
the rope with them.</p>

<p><i>Monday, the 30th.</i>—In the morning there were
light clouds, but the sun was more or less visible,
and from its position I judged that we got up at
about eight o’clock. (Finn and H. were the only
two whose watches were still going, and they
didn’t agree particularly well.) I spent the morning
in camp, washing myself and my clothes,
cleaning my revolver, etc. In the afternoon I set
out up the rocks behind camp; they were very
rotten, and I got into considerable difficulties,
especially at one point, where, my foothold having
disappeared, I dangled for some time by my fingers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
in imminent expectation of returning to camp in a
rather undignified, not to say disorderly, manner.
At last I got a knee up to the ledge, and soon
stood on the ridge, in which was a large seam of
coal, six or eight feet wide. Along this crest, then
over snow-beds, and then up more rock, always
more or less rotten, I reached a height of between
four and five thousand feet, from which I had a
magnificent view of the wide sweeps of the Tyndall
Glacier below me, but to the north and west I was
cut off by the spurs of the peak I was on. It was
very thick in the south, and rain was evidently
driving up, so I determined to descend promptly,
and, by making a detour to the right, found a
much easier way down, and got in just as the rain
began. It was only slight, and kindly left off
during supper, but then went on all night.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, the 31st.</i>—In the morning the camp
was enveloped in thin clouds. As the sun was
quite invisible, we had no ideas of time; but just
after breakfast, while we were still sitting round
the fire, the rain having left off and the clouds
dispersed a good deal, the men suddenly said
‘(K)hoots’ (the guttural being the same as in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Arabic <i>Khamsin</i>—something like the German <i>ich</i>),
and looking up at once, I saw two bears leisurely
crossing the stones on the Coal Glacier, about three
hundred yards off, going diagonally across towards
the point below us. Hurriedly telling the Indians
to keep quiet, I sneaked down to the tent, got H.’s
big telescope (how I longed for a rifle!) and had
a splendid view of them.</p>

<p>The first was the much-talked-of ‘blue’ bear
at last. The body was slate-colour, much lighter
on the back, with a very well-marked white crescent
on the shoulders, while the head was nearly, if not
quite, black. He was decidedly smaller than the
other, which was an undersized cinnamon. The
blue one was also much neater-looking and smarter
in his gait, the pair resembling a park-hack followed
by a cart-horse. The brown one had, I think, seen
the tent, for he kept stopping and staring in our
direction, but the blue kept quietly on, and when
he reached the point at about two hundred yards
from the camp, he lay down in the long grass.
The other came on after him, but, instead of lying
down, wandered about in a restless manner. After
about five minutes, the blue one got up, and, followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
by the brown, came leisurely towards us
along the slope. I heard the men whispering
nervously together behind my back, and when the
bears were about a hundred yards off they couldn’t
stand it any longer, but gave vent to a most
fiendish yell, which made me nearly drop the
telescope, while the bears, puffing and snorting,
rushed wildly up the hill and disappeared over
the ridge. I went down to inspect their tracks at
a place where they had crossed a small patch of
snow at the edge of the glacier, and found them
to be totally different. The blue had gone with
his heel down the whole time, like the black
bear, while the brown’s tracks only showed the
print of the fore-part of the foot. From this and
from the general appearance of the animal, I have
but little doubt that these blue ones are a variety
of the black bear. No doubt, as in the case of the
black bear in other parts of America, they will
breed with the brown ones, and hence puzzling
variations are met with, such as a skin I afterwards
saw at Yakutat, which had been obtained
near Dry Bay, and was of a uniform yellowish
grey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Halleck is the only author on Alaska in whose
works I have found any mention of this bear. He
says (‘Our New Alaska,’ p. 166): ‘Up on the
ridges back of Mount St. Elias, which constitute a
favourite (<i>sic</i>) hunting-ground for goats, is found a
bear similar to the roach-back or silver-tip of the
Rockies, but of a beautiful bluish undercolour,
with the tips of the long hairs silvery white. The
traders call it the St. Elias silver bear.’ In another
place (p. 160) he says: ‘Besides there is a small
albino bear found on the coast, which is known as
the coast bear. Being white and a good deal about
the ice in winter, some have supposed it to be a
variety of polar bear, but the zoologists dispute it.’
My own impression is that these bears are the
same, the white variety not being an albino, but
the blue bear with his winter coat on. I could
only hear of two of these white bears having been
killed—one at Chilcaht, the other on the Taku
Glacier, near Juneau, and this latter was described
as having been almost white. The blue skins are
also very rare, as much as seventy-five dollars being
given for a good one. They seem to rather prefer
the company of their brown brethren, as Shorty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
a few days later saw three bears on the glacier, of
which one was brown and two blue; and Anthony,
the Sitka watchmaker, whom we first met at
Yakutat, whither he had come prospecting up the
coast, met four near Dry Bay, some brown and
some blue, but I forget the exact proportion.</p>

<p>After lunch I set to work to prepare a sumptuous
supper, as I expected the others back that evening.
I made a pudding by boiling rice and dried peaches
together, and even added some sugar, which had
become a rare and precious commodity, so that I
did not use it while the others were away. I then
left the pot in the snow to cool, put a goose to
stew on a slow fire, and wandered up a little way
beyond camp to make a sketch of the glacier.
About five o’clock the weather improved, the
clouds gradually disappearing and the sun being
pleasantly warm. The others did not return, and
the pudding was so good that about half of it was
eaten at supper, but I put the rest by for next day.
After supper I went out on to the Tyndall Glacier
and had a grand view of the mountain, though
there were still some clouds about. I could see no
sign of the others, but took a lot of bearings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wednesday, August the 1st.</i>—It was so cold in
the night that I woke up several times and got up
pretty early. (Having the tent all to myself and
without the ground-sheet no doubt contributed to
this.) Making bread for breakfast exhausted the
flour, so I started the men off to get some more
from Camp H, and went down with them as far as
the Daisy Glacier. On the way I had to pitch
into Master Jimmy pretty severely; the crevasses
at the junction of the Coal and Tyndall Glaciers
gave us some little trouble from having kept too
near to the latter, and one of these was spanned by
an exceedingly frail snow-bridge. Merely glancing
at it, I went some thirty yards lower down, and,
looking back as I crossed, saw, to my horror, that,
though Billy was following me all right, Jimmy,
who had been a little behind, was crossing the
rotten bridge, which he traversed in safety, but two
or three strokes from my ice-axe sent it tinkling
into the depths, and why it did not give way with
him is a great mystery. Jimmy looked rather
awestruck, and I pointed out to him with some
vigour the necessity of following absolutely in my
tracks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>The weather was again perfect, and on arriving
at the Daisy Glacier I let them go on, while I
turned on to the glacier, up which I went for
nearly three miles, when my eyes began to ache a
good deal, and, as some <i>schrunds</i> appeared which
threatened to prove awkward for a solitary climber,
I returned. In the lower part of the Daisy there
are hardly any crevasses, and in consequence there
are some very fine <i>moulins</i>, while the surface was
there in many parts very swampy, if such an
expression can be used, a thin crust of snow overlying
the wet glacier. As I had expected, it had
a small outflow on its south side, about half a mile
from its junction with the Tyndall; and the stream
from this, augmented by another from the latter
glacier, runs into the little lake by Camp H, and
so gets back to the glacier.</p>

<p>I made a slight sketch of Mount St. Elias from
the terminal moraine, and got back to camp about
one o’clock (estimated), visiting on the way the
big blocks on the Coal Glacier, the biggest of
which probably contained about six thousand cubic
feet. I found that the others had been over for
stores and the kerosene stove, and H. had left a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
note saying that I could go down and wait for
them at G, and that they would be back in four
days. Among other things they had carried off
the small kettle with the remains of the rice-pudding,
and so got their share after all. They
left the skins of four young marmots to be
stretched and dried. These afterwards vanished
when we were camped at Yakutat, presumably the
prey of some Indian dog. The men came back
about two o’clock, and after lunch we also went
hunting marmots, which they called <i>tsahkh</i>; but
though we got pretty near one or two, and dug up
a great deal of the hill-side, the only results were
the expenditure of a few revolver-cartridges and
the not uncommon one of smashing the stock of
an ice-axe.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">BACK TO THE SHORE</span></h2>

<p><i>Thursday, the 2nd.</i>—In the odds and ends sack
I had found an extra flannel shirt, and, fortified by
this, was not much troubled by the cold, though I
was not too warm in spite of the thick vest, two
flannel shirts, leather waistcoat, Norfolk jacket,
and macintosh, that I put on before creeping into
my blanket-bag. I had announced to the Indians
that we were going back, and their delight got
them up first for a wonder, though indeed as we
returned they were generally the first to move,
in their eagerness to escape from the detested
country. At this camp they had been chanting
the most doleful ditties, and when I inquired what
it was all about, they said, ‘Siwash sick tum-tum,
want go home.’ Among Indians the tummy is
generally regarded as the seat of the feelings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>To get everything into one load the packs had
to be very heavy. Billy had about a hundred
pounds and Jimmy very little less, while in addition
to my own properties I had kettles, frying-pan,
and tent-poles. We left a small cache for the
others, and our last goose, but we hoped to get some
more at H, and were off by about seven o’clock.
On the Daisy Glacier we found fresh bear-tracks,
much larger than those of the two who had paid
us a visit, but we saw nothing of the beast himself.
Putting up lots of ptarmigan in the hollow of the
little stream by which we descended to cross the
ravine, we went on past H to the site of
Schwatka’s last camp, flushing more ptarmigan
by the stream there. Altogether I fired five
pistol-shots at them, and got a young one with
my last. It was well-grown and about the size of
a French partridge. We pitched camp at the
edge of the glacier, and after lunch the men went
back to fetch the things cached at H, and to try
for geese, but they only got one small one, all the
rest being able to fly. Meanwhile I took my
ptarmigan on to the glacier, to avoid the flies, and
tried to skin it. This was not very easy, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
bullet had smashed both shoulders, but I managed
it in a sort of a way, and then went for a bit across
the glacier towards the Chaix Hills to get some
idea of the lie of the crevasses. We had an
excellent supper, and the men displayed marvellous
appetites, eating the whole of their goose, the
legs of my bird, and two goes of rice-pudding, but
I think they were then tolerably crowded. After
this I started to climb the last little hill, which
looks like an island from the opposite side of the
glacier, but coming on more ptarmigan, fired my
last five cartridges and got an old bird. I ought
certainly to have had two more, but the pistol was
so foul that accuracy was impossible, while only
three of the chambers would work. Coming back,
I drove two or three young ones on to the moraine,
and, shouting for Billy and Jimmy, we pursued
wildly for about half-an-hour, the men barefooted
and I with only moccasins on, so that it would
have been amusing to observe our skips and
hops when we lighted on a sharper stone than
usual. At last the one we had selected was too
beat to fly any more, and Billy finally succeeded in
knocking him over with a better aimed rock than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
usual, most of their shots being awfully wild. Just
as we were going to turn in we heard a curious
cry, something between the bleat of a sheep and
the mew of a cat. The men said, though rather
doubtfully, that it was a bear, and shouted vigorously
to frighten it away, but we heard it again
afterwards, and I fancy it may have been a lynx.</p>

<p><i>Friday, the 3rd.</i>—I again woke several times in
the night from the cold, and could hear the ptarmigan
calling quite close to the tent. We did not
get up till rather late, and got off about nine
o’clock, leaving sundry properties which I intended
Mike and Matthew, who had been luxuriating at
the beach, to have the pleasure of fetching.
Thinking, from my survey of the previous day, that
we could improve on the way we had come, I
struck right in nearly to the centre of the glacier,
and for a long way we had very good going with
hardly any crevasses; but as we approached the
two conical mounds which made such a land-mark
on the Tyndall Glacier, we got some very bad
moraine indeed, and in one place I nearly succeeded
in breaking my leg by pulling a loosely-perched
boulder on to myself. It came to an end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
at last, and we got up to G about noon, where we
found no sign of the other men. After pitching
the tent and examining the cache, which, like
all our others, had been left untouched by four-footed
prowlers, we lunched, and I then had a
delicious bathe in the little tarn. The men slept
most of the afternoon while I skinned the ptarmigan,
a futile task, as it was found impossible to
preserve the skins by the time I got home. At
supper-time the view was unusually fine; a thin
layer of cloud hid the many crevasses of the
Guyot Glacier, as a veil conceals the wrinkles of a
faded beauty, while above this the peaks to the
west showed with unusual grandeur, especially the
long snow-clad mass which we had christened
Snowshoe Mountain. Later on the clouds thinned
off a great deal, and St. Elias, which had been
banded with mist all day, came out quite clear.
The flowers on the hills, especially the violets, were
mostly over, but I found a fine rose-coloured lupin
among the blue ones at the edge of the lake.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, the 4th.</i>—The day dawned brilliantly
fine and hot. After a bathe I mended my clothes,
and then, putting my luncheon in my pocket,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
wandered over the hills, taking a good many
bearings with the sextant. As I came leisurely
back along the edge of the glacier lake, which was
very bad walking, I flushed sundry ptarmigan, one
of which, an old one, perched in the top of a dead
fir-tree. Just as I reached the end of the lake I
heard shouts, and, hurrying to the glacier, found
H. and W. E. was behind with the men, and, as
Shorty had a bad ankle and the packs were very
heavy, we sent the Indians to help them. While
they related their adventures I got supper ready
for them.</p>

<p>After leaving Camp I, they crossed the Tyndall
Glacier for about half-an-hour, and then put on
the rope. The crevasses were very bad, and
covered with rotten snow, so that it was with
difficulty that they made their way to the foot of
Mount St. Elias, and established a camp on the
last grassy slope that was visible. The scenery
was very grand, resembling the view up the Mer
de Glace from the Montanvert, but on a far larger
scale. The double ice-fall of the Tyndall Glacier
was well seen, divided by a small island of rock;
further to the right were two very steep and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
narrow glaciers, resembling frozen waterfalls. This
camp had been reached at half-past ten (three
and a half hours’ going), and at twelve they sallied
forth to explore, and mounted round the camp
hill, keeping it on the right. Two hours up a
rather steep ascent brought them to the top of a
snow col connecting the camp hill with one of the
arêtes leading to the rim of the crater which was
then their object. The arête was of loose shale,
everything giving way directly it was touched, but,
apart from that, the climbing was not difficult, and
after reaching a height of about six thousand feet
they turned back at 4.30 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>, undecided as to the
morrow. Having left the stove and kerosene
behind, they expected to have to live on cold food,
but found moss and shrubbery enough to make a
small fire.</p>

<p>Next morning they left at 8 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>, with the
intention of continuing the same arête, but in
half-an-hour they changed to the next one on the
left, and in two hours reached a height slightly
greater than that of the day before. The walking
was terrible, over loose shale and steep dirt giving
no real foothold. They followed the edge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
arête for the rest of the day, sending down
quantities of stones. Then came a little snow,
part of which was solid ice, and H. had to cut
a hundred and fifty steps, which took the best part
of an hour and a half. At four o’clock they
reached the summit of the arête, but, though on
the brink of the crater, could see nothing, owing
to mist. The height, 7,725 feet, was at all events
better than Seton-Karr’s, and they built a cairn
and left the flag, hardly hoping to get any higher.
After a hasty lunch they descended, reaching camp
at 10 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> They could see that the Tyndall
Glacier makes two long and beautiful sweeps round
the foot of St. Elias, full of tremendous crevasses,
and though, if time were no object, it might be
possible to ascend it, it could never be a practicable
route to the summit.</p>

<p>The next day they made a day of rest, which
was diversified by Shorty and Lyons slaying in
the morning with stones eight out of a covey of
ptarmigan, while in the evening they succeeded
in smoking out and killing four baby marmots.</p>

<p>On Wednesday they all came over to the Coal
Glacier Camp in an hour and a half, found me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
absent, and carried off the stove and sundry stores,
including the rice-pudding. In the evening they
went up to a bit of moraine east of, and just
beneath, the snow col connecting the camp hill
with their first arête, and slept there, leaving at
4.40 next morning, and keeping steadily up the
arête till their arrival at the top. There was no
difficulty, it was only a sort of treadmill over the
loose shale and slate. They kept to the edge of
the arête the whole way, and at the point where it
articulates with the mountain they went first up
loose débris, and then over a little snow, whence
they diverged to climb a nice bit of sandstone,
and reached the rim of the crater at 7.10.</p>

<p>After ten minutes’ halt they continued along
the brink to the summit of the arête climbed on
the 30th of July, which was reached at 7.40.
They then steered north-west over the snow
towards the upper lip of the crater, having to
double back considerably to avoid some <i>schrunds</i>.
Once above these, they ascended a little snow and
then a tedious slope of loose shale, while on their
right was a steep snow-slope, in too dangerous a
condition for climbing. Near the top of this they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
met with some more fine rocks of grey sandstone
which gave them their second ten minutes of real
climbing, and they then rested for lunch from 10.10
to 10.55. The aneroid gave a height of 9,500 feet,
and to reach 10,000 they had to go a considerable
distance. Just above the sandstone rocks came
the top of the snow-slope alongside of which they
had been climbing. It proved here to be ice, and
they had to cut up it, slanting to the right so as to
reach the top, where a sort of cornice was at its
best. The last part was dangerous, the ice being
loose and granular, while the last few feet were so
steep that it was necessary to kneel in the steps.
Above this they found a snow-field stretching in
waves round the brink of the crater. The snow
was very trying, being often above their knees,
while large crevasses separated the elevations from
the depressions, and wherever the grade was steep
the snow changed to ice. They kept on this till
they were about due north of the crater, when
they had their second lunch at a height of 11,375
feet, as shown on working out the boiling-point
observations, and then went on to the foot of
the highest rocks that formed part of the eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
edge of the crater. These were steep and mostly
covered with snow, in which were large crevasses.
The snow mounted in sweeps and terraces to the
top of the rocks, which they estimated as about
a thousand feet above them. They would have
much liked to have ascended these, but the day
was advanced, the wind rising, and the sun spoiling
their steps, so that they thought it more prudent
to return.</p>

<p>At this point they were above the col joining
Haydon Peak to Mount St. Elias, but could not
see the col itself. They could see, however, that
the final peak, which they then estimated as being
some six thousand feet above them, would be
difficult and perhaps impossible from this col.
On the further side it would first be necessary to
climb east to avoid an overhanging glacier; then
to ascend over rocks, snow, and some green ice
which might perhaps be avoided by some steep
rocks to the left, but all the climbing up this first
thousand feet would be very severe. Afterwards
it would be easier, up a snow-slope till above what
appears as a mound from below (1,500 to 2,000
feet above the col), then north over a comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
level snow-field; then up steep snow and
rocks to the edge of the true south arête which
runs up for about four thousand feet to the
summit, chiefly consisting of snow and not steep.
The upper half is steeper, but there is no rock,
and there would be no difficulty there or on the
south-east face, unless, as is very probable, what
seems to be snow is in reality ice. Lower down
they could see distinctly that this was so, and
therefore abandoned all idea of sleeping on the col.</p>

<p>The south-west face is a mass of hanging
glaciers. The brow on which they were is seen
from below as a wall of snow fringing the top of
the crater; on the other side this snow falls away
rapidly to the glacier which winds down from the
north-east to the head of the Tyndall Glacier.
From there no route to the col could be made, as
the ice is far too broken, and should any one force
the Tyndall ice-fall his best course would be to
cross the glacier to a low rock arête, which would
take him to some snow-fields whence he might
turn west and gain the huge north-west arête of
the mountain. By this he could reach the west
shoulder and the way would be simple.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
The weather being perfect, their view was
magnificent. To the north-west the ranges were
low, but the glaciers went winding out of sight.
Mount Wrangel could not be seen, but Fairweather
was distinctly visible. On their descent they found
the snow and steps much worse. They left Mrs.
Haydon’s flag in a meat-tin under a pile of stones
at the foot of the sandstone rocks where they made
their first lunch, as above this there was no place
of security, and got back to camp about nine
o’clock.</p>

<p>Next day they crossed over to Camp I, and on
the Saturday descended to G, going, at Shorty’s
suggestion, all along the Tyndall Glacier, but came
to the conclusion that it was not an improvement.
As the other men had not turned up, Billy and
Jimmy were informed, to their great disgust, that
they would have to go next morning and fetch the
cache left at J.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, the 5th.</i>—W. woke us all up in the
night by shouting in his sleep, ‘Lyons, Lyons, a
serac is falling on the tent!’ for which he was unmercifully
chaffed. The Indians arose at some
unearthly hour and went off to J, getting back at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
eight o’clock. At 6.30 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> W. went off to try and
turn the west end of the opposite range, which we
had christened the Ptarmigan Hills. He could
persuade no one to go with him as we all believed,
first, that the hills could not be turned, owing to
the crevassed state of the Guyot Glacier, and
secondly, that if he did turn them he would only
see another point beyond. We bathed and
sketched, and at about noon Ed. and Finn turned
up, followed half-an-hour later by Matthew and
Gums, who had laudably endeavoured to find a
better way through the crevasses on the Guyot
Glacier, but had failed signally. Gums had come
up in Mike’s place, as the latter’s feet were very
sore.</p>

<p>They had had rainy weather on the beach
nearly the whole time. A lot of the Yakutats had
been there sea-otter hunting with considerable
success, and Jack Dalton had camped for one
night. He brought the news that the body of a
white man had been found at Point Manby, thrown
up with a fishing dory. The poor fellow must
have got among the breakers at night, and he had
thrown out a drag to keep the boat head on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
them, but must have swamped as he reached the
shore. From the tracks they saw that he was able
to crawl up the beach on his hands and knees into
the bush, and whether he died there from exhaustion
or was killed by a bear no one could say, but
it is to be hoped he was dead before the bear got
him. No one recognised the boat or knew anything
which might lead to discovering his name.
They buried what was left of him there, and put
the dory over his grave.</p>

<p>Our men had had a fair time among the flesh-pots
on the shore, as, though the Indians had got
no more seals, they had shot several swans and
geese. The men came up in two days, making a
camp as before at the place where the river issues
from the ice, but succeeded in getting down in one
day of sixteen hours. The water was very high,
and they had to make a raft before they could
cross one creek. After lunch Lyons and I went
after ptarmigan with our pistols; Shorty also
started with the rifle which had been brought up
from the first cache, but his leg was too bad and he
had to go back. He looked for me to give me the
rifle, but I had vanished down a ravine. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
were not very many ptarmigan, while the ground
was so broken that it was almost impossible to
mark them. I only fired two shots; Lyons was
luckier, firing ten or twelve, and getting one bird,
which he nearly lost, for he fixed it in his belt by
its head, and looking down after a time found head
<i>et præterea nil</i>. Retracing his steps carefully he
managed to find the corpse. We heard W. also
popping away vigorously on the other side of the
glacier, but he returned <i>bredouille</i> without having
got round the end of the hills. After supper Finn
went out with the rifle and got two ptarmigan.
He hit a goose, but it escaped into the lake. We
decided to make an early start for the shore, so as
to avail ourselves of the continued fine weather
and get back to Yakutat as soon as possible.</p>

<p><i>Monday, the 6th.</i>—Moved by the hope of
speedily leaving the regions they so thoroughly
loathed, the Indians were astir early, and by four
o’clock the whole party was up. Finn fried the
two ptarmigan for breakfast, but as it was discovered
that the Indians had been greasing their
boots with the fat in the frying-pan, no one seemed
inclined to partake of the dish. We got off by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
5.30, and went down to the Guyot Glacier, along
which we proceeded at a great pace as the packs
were pretty light. We got through the crevasses
without much difficulty, and, though we had some
rather muddy bits near Lake Castani, we cleared
the Chaix Hills at nine o’clock, abandoning to
their fate a few stores which had been left in the
cache made at the point where our trail from F
struck the glacier, Ed., Matthew, and Mike having
found more than they could bring up on July 26.
Keeping about half-a-mile to the west of the depression
between the glaciers, we reached the head
of the river at eleven. The water boils out finely
from under the ice, but, though it was higher than
when the men had last come up, the gravel-flat on
which they had then slept being now covered, the
volume was not as great as I had expected, being
perhaps equal to that of the Visp where it joins
the Rhone.</p>

<p>We rested a bit on the beach, and then came
on in very scattered order to the cache, the two
miles taking about two hours, as the alder-bush on
the face of the moraine was very bad, and the
stream was too high for us to get along on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
flats by wading every now and then, as the men
had generally been able to do. H., who stopped
to photograph, went all wrong, away from the
river towards Camp C, and as he came back fell
foul of a wasp’s nest, and got stung in two or three
places. Jimmy, who was one of the first at the
cache, earned our high approval by coming back
of his own accord to help Shorty in with his load.
We were all collected by half-past two, and rested
all the afternoon. Supper was at 4.30, and we at
last got hold of the dried vegetables, which the
men had always forgotten to bring up, and made
some splendid soup. Just above the cache E.
found a white willow-herb, and I collected some
seed of the red kind to try in England.</p>

<p>While we were resting in the afternoon Matthew
told us that the Indians called the river Yahkhtze-tah-heen
(Muddy Harbour River), and Mount St.
Elias Yahkhtze-tah-shah (Muddy Harbour Mountain).
George, the second chief of Yakutat, afterwards
told us that there used to be two villages,
one on the sea and the other at the foot of St. Elias,
but that the glaciers came down and destroyed
them, according to him, in a single night. As the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Alaska glaciers are all rapidly receding, this must
have been a very long time ago, for a hundred
years back, when the country was first visited,
there was far more ice than there is now, Vancouver
having been unable to enter Glacier Bay
for the ice, while Icy Bay, even on modern charts,
is represented as being of a V-shape from the
glaciers running out on either side, whereas it now
hardly deserves the name of a bay at all.</p>

<p>Meaning to make an early start, we turned in
at six o’clock, but were driven wild by the millions
of mosquitoes that invaded our tent. By this time
we were thoroughly inoculated against the effects
of their bites, but their continuous trumpeting
destroyed all chance of sleep; after a time we
arose and drove out and slew as many as we could,
after which we endeavoured to close up every
possible aperture. Our success was but partial,
but we managed to get a little sleep.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, the 7th.</i>—We got up at 4 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>, and
were off by 5.45; an hour’s steady going brought
us down to Camp B, and we went on by the old
route to the point where Gums declared Schwatka
had had a camp. Here we turned to the left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
instead of keeping down the main river. At first
we had a good lot of wading, but presently reached
some flats, over which we made more satisfactory
progress. At this point some wild-geese were
discovered far ahead, and Shorty set forth to stalk
them; as, however, he was unwilling to crawl over
the wet mud, his six-foot-four frightened them
away while he was still three or four hundred
yards off. On these flats were a great many small
frogs, of which most of the Indians were much
afraid, holding some kind of superstition about
them; but Matthew and Jimmy were apparently
sceptics, and the latter, with a sly look at us, put a
frog on the back of Billy, who, though his great
friend, was perfectly furious, and for a minute I
thought we were going to have a first-class row.</p>

<p>At last we approached the deep creek where
the men had once had to make a raft. Now the
crossing appeared feasible, but it was hard to be
sure, as all the neighbouring land on our side was
under water. In the midst of this was a stranded
log, where we rested and took off our coats, fastening
them on to our packs, which we carried on our
heads. H. planted the camera in the water, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
prepared to photograph the passage. Gums, of
course, led; and at the second attempt discovered
a place where the water was hardly over his armpits.
This was all right for the taller ones of us,
but E. went in well up to his chin, as did Finn,
who, losing his footing, vanished with his pack.
Great was the dismay till it was discovered that he
was only carrying the bacon. Jimmy also disappeared
altogether, and had eventually to be convoyed
across by Gums and Matthew. Last of all
came W. and H., the latter bearing the camera.
He chanced on a deepish place, and nearly went
under, but struggled on, quoting: ‘And nobly
Father Tiber bare up his faltering chin’—which
chin, decked with a ruddy beard, had dipped
beneath the icy wave before he emerged on the
other side.</p>

<p>Three-quarters of an hour through the trees,
and then a little wading, brought us to the mouth
of the first river at eleven o’clock, and we halted
for a little lunch and a great many strawberries,
which were not yet over in shady places or long
grass. We then pushed on along the beach to
camp, the packs being brought down the lagoon in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the small canoe, and arrived at 1.15, hoping to
start at once for Yakutat; but the other Indians
had gone hunting, and we had to await their return,
which was not till five o’clock. After some supper
we got off at 6.20; it was perfectly calm, and we
didn’t ship a drop of water, or get wet above our
knees. There was a five-gallon can of kerosene
which we said could be left on the beach; Mike,
however, wished to take it in the small canoe, but
Gums, after a lively argument, settled the question
by driving an ice-axe into it. It was a fair squeeze
for twelve in the big canoe; I curled up just forward
of the bow oar, the other three were in the
stern, and hardly so well off. We rowed and paddled
to Cape Sitkagi (10 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>), when a fresh breeze from
the west sprang up, and, towing the small canoe,
we sailed to Point Manby, which we passed at
4 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span></p>

<p><i>Wednesday, the 8th.</i>—The breeze then began to
die away, and vanished at five, so we had to row
again, and got to Yakutat at ten o’clock. De
Groff greeted us, and gave us four breakfast, which
included the unwonted luxuries of butter and honey;
the men, who were a little sulky after their night’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
exertions, cooked theirs on his stove. Then H.
paid off Ed., Finn, and the Yakutats, and arranged
to leave our Indians in the village as before, after
which we went over to the Swedish Mission on the
mainland opposite, and encamped in the yard.
Ed. came too, and Finn followed in the evening.
We bathed in the sea, which was decidedly cold;
but the lake at the back was too muddy, and also
too near George’s ranche to be pleasant. De Groff
expected the ‘Alpha’ to arrive about the 10th.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">LIFE AT YAKUTAT</span></h2>

<p><i>Thursday and Friday, August the 9th and 10th.</i>—We
wandered about the two villages hunting
curios, but without much result, though I got a
rather neat model of the skin bidarky. We got
some excellent clams from the Indians, and a good
lot of strawberries which W. and I hulled. We
tried to arrange with Ned to take us up in his
canoe to Disenchantment Bay, but there was a
‘potlatch’ in prospect, and he declined to make
any agreement.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, the 11th.</i>—Very fine and hot. Our
Indians came over by order, and Matthew and
Mike were set to cut wood, while the others took
the boat to fetch water, an operation which involved
some little time as the nearest good water
was about a mile away. Having nothing better to do,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
H. undertook to make a pudding of corn-meal
and raisins for supper. While we were all sitting
round watching, the fire, as was its wont, began
to collapse, and the kettle of water for the coffee
took a header into the ashes. ‘Thank goodness,’
said H., ‘it’s not the pudding.’ Even as he spoke
another log gave way and the pudding joined the
coffee-water. However it was soon re-made, but
proved better cold than hot. Just after supper
great excitement was caused by an aged crone, who
was leaning on the palings, pointing out to sea and
saying ‘schooner,’ but, on bringing the telescope
to bear, it proved to be only a big iceberg drifting
down from Disenchantment Bay.</p>

<p>In the evening Sub-chief George came round to
pay us a visit, and <i>said</i> that he and nine other
Indians had once seen the back of Mount St. Elias,
when after goats, and that it was a gentle snow-slope.
They landed at Cape Yaktagi, which he
described as being a better beach than Icy Bay.
There used once to be a village there, the westernmost
point to which the Tlinkits ever reached,
but now only three tumble-down houses are left.
They went up the <i>right</i> bank of the river Kokhtasch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
for a day, and then for two days along
moraine at the back of Mount Snowshoe and the
range north of it, which was green and nearly clear
of snow on that side; they then turned east for
half a day over ice and saw the mountain as described.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Murphy’s little eleven-ton
schooner, the ‘Active,’ came down from Disenchantment
Bay, where he, Callsen, and Dalton had
been prospecting, and had found coal in a spot
where it seemed so likely to pay that some of them
went back later from Sitka to winter there, so as
to begin working it directly spring began.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, the 12th.</i>—Very fine, with a light west
wind. As we were short of meat Lyons and I
took the canoe along the shore towards Ankau
Creek, where we found several flocks of small
plover, and I shot about thirty. I had only No. 4
shot; with No. 8 or 10 the bag would probably
have been doubled. In the afternoon Murphy
came over; W. wanted to go down with him, but
they were already very full. He managed it at
last by exchanging places with Finn, who was to
stay and go down with us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Monday, the 13th.</i>—The ‘Active’ sailed at six,
and W. went over about four o’clock. He must
have left the shed door open, and some dogs have
made their entrance, for H.’s sealskin gloves were
found outside, and my model bidarky had vanished
altogether; Ned subsequently discovered it unhurt
in the bushes outside. These Siwash dogs were
a horrid nuisance, and we several times rose in the
night to pursue them, but without result, as they
always escaped by the holes in the palings before
we could stop them up. Once they got into the
store-tent by digging under the side, and went off
with a bit of bacon and the only piece of cheese in
Yakutat.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, the 14th.</i>—This afternoon the potlatch
began in the second house. These potlatches
generally follow a funeral or some great misfortune;
thus an Indian at Dry Bay, who possessed
three large trading canoes, had one of them
wrecked and some men drowned, on which he
promptly held a potlatch and gave away the other
two canoes and all the rest of his property, with
the view of appeasing the anger of the Great
Spirit. A potlatch is sometimes, but very rarely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
held for the purpose of gaining influence in the
tribe in order that the donor may some day
succeed to the position of chief. This one we
attended was consequent on the exhumation and
reburial of the ashes of members of the two
families.</p>

<p>Just before proceedings commenced Matthew
summoned us, and ushered us in in great pew-opener
style. We were rather surprised at finding
blankets spread for us in the place of honour facing
the door, as we had been told they might perhaps
object to our presence, so we were pleased and said
they really did know how to do things in Yakutat.
About two hundred spectators crowded in, and
there was consequently a fairish ‘froust.’ A
blanket was then held up over the small oval hole
which served as a doorway, and the play began.
The ‘Ravens,’ seventeen men, four women, and
three boys, wondrously painted and arrayed,
came and thundered on the wall outside, after
which the old doctor, who wore a curious wooden
mask representing a raven’s head, crept under the
blanket, and singing and yelling postured slowly
down the three or four steps from the door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
followed gradually by the rest, howling at the top
of their voices. When they were all in they
danced, but only for a short time. Some of the
head-dresses, made of ermine-skins and abelone
shells, were very quaint.</p>

<p>They then retired, and, after a pause during
which we all went out for some fresh air, the
‘Eagles’ entered in the same way. This time we saw
the old chief and doctor both skip into the house at
the first warning with somewhat undignified haste,
and when we followed, we found them ensconced in
the place of honour, and realised that we had been
intruders before, though they had been too polite
to turn us out. We huddled into a corner, and
watched the performance, which was much the
same. Gums and Jimmy were in great form, skipping
about as if they were birds, and waving their
arms wrapped in cloaks. Our George was also
most resplendent, having on his head De Groff’s
big tin funnel decorated with skins and red feathers.
One blanket was then torn up and distributed, and
then came a long wait, so H., Finn, and Shorty
went back with the missionaries.</p>

<p>E., Lyons, and I stayed, but this time took up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
a position near the door so as to occasionally get
a little fresh air. The women, drawn up in two
rows on the dais on either side, swayed and bobbed,
chanting at the pitch of their lungs. They all
wore the same dark-blue and scarlet cloak, and
had red feathers and worsted in their hair, making
a decidedly striking picture. Most of them wore
sharks’-teeth earrings, to which they attach an
enormous importance, the lowest price we heard
of being twelve dollars for a pair. After this
a lot of blankets and calico were cut up and
given away, and we left them hard at it about five
o’clock. As the tide had risen in the meantime,
Lyons had to wade in a good way after the canoe,
which had been secured to the stump of a tree.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, the 15th.</i>—After breakfast I went
off with Finn and Lyons in the canoe to Ankau
Creek, but the tide was running out so strongly
that we did not attempt to go up it, but landed,
and Lyons and I went up along the shore, while
Finn searched for strawberries, of which there were
still a few to be found. We followed up the creek
for nearly a mile, but, saw nothing in the way of
game, and as the rocks were decidedly unpleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
to our moccasined feet we returned to the canoe
and crossed to Yakutat, where most of the Indians
were still in bed, having kept up the potlatch till
five in the morning, and distributed some three
thousand yards of calico, according to De Groff.
We lunched there, and sailed home about four
o’clock. The chief’s garden was being stripped of
its produce, turnip, beet, and a few onions, with a
view to the approaching feast.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, the 16th.</i>—Grey and cloudy, with a
south-east wind which ought to bring the ‘Alpha’
now. De Groff came over to lunch and took a
photograph of us ‘in camp,’ and also of the
Swedish Mission. The Indians were potlatching
again to-day; one woman gave away twenty-one
blankets and a lot of calico. Occasionally great
swells, like the chief or the doctor, got a whole
blanket. These doctors or medicine-men used to
have tremendous power in the tribe, but this has
much diminished before the advance of civilisation.
Their initiation into their full M.D. degree used to
consist in a prolonged solitary fast in the forests,
till, overtaken by a sort of frenzy, they rushed back
to the village, where such people as desired to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
show a fine religious fervour would offer their arms
for the doctor to take bites out of. Other Indians
when dead are cremated, but the doctors are
buried in a little wooden hut in some isolated spot,
or on a point of rock overlooking the sea; and of
late years these huts have been ruthlessly ravaged
for curios, since the doctor’s charms and other
implements are always buried with him; but if the
sacrilegious prowler was caught it would be very
awkward for him in a wild place like Yakutat. The
common American term for these medicine-men is
<i>shaman</i>, apparently a corruption of the Russian
<i>shawaan</i>, but the Tlinkits themselves use the word
<i>icht</i>. The doctor at Yakutat was a filthy old
scoundrel, with hair about six feet long; he had
been half-blind for years, having at one time
headed an attack against a French storekeeper
(named, I believe, Belœil, but the men always
spoke of him as Bellew), who had checked the
onslaught with a well-aimed dose of sulphuric
acid.</p>

<p>During the potlatch sundry relics of the
deceased made their appearance, and were wept
over with much emotion, genuine tears being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
produced in abundance. Some of the old men,
who had nothing else, gave tobacco, a small pinch
being put in the fire each time for the spirits of
the departed.</p>

<p><i>Friday, the 17th.</i>—Dull and grey, and threatening
rain. Yesterday and to-day the flies were
something fearful, and we had even to walk up
and down when feeding, while any liquid, such as
soup or tea, was thick with them. As the baking-powder
was all but finished, Finn, who was supposed
to be rather good at the art, was deputed to
make sour-dough bread, but it was not much of
a success, resembling plain heavy buns. The
leaven was presumably too new, for afterwards it
worked admirably.</p>

<p>The Indians began their feast about four
o’clock. Each man had his own bowl, while by
the fire were large dishes full of rice, berries
cooked in seal-oil, and what looked like some preparation
of fish. After a brief invocation a little
of each was put in the fire, and then the bowls
were filled and they began. I was over on the
island by myself, and H. came across in the
smallest canoe to fetch me. Half-way over we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
met E. in another, who, unaware that his brother
had started, was coming over with the same
intention, and, instead of being pleased at not
having to go any further, seemed to consider
himself aggrieved. We often saw Siwash dogs
swimming across, the distance being quite a mile.
In the morning we purchased through Mike two
salmon for ten cents, which sounds cheap, but
after all the money was wasted, as a few minutes
later Billy and Matthew turned up in a canoe with
two dozen they had speared, so we took six of the
best.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, the 18th.</i>—Raining all day, with some
very heavy showers, so we stayed in the Mission
most of the time. The house consisted of one
furnished room, which Hendrickson and Lydell
inhabited, one unfurnished one, which they politely
put at our disposal, and another large one, at that
time unfloored, which was to be the school-room.
We said we would sleep in the house as the
weather was so bad, but at supper-time it cleared
a bit, and H. elected to stay in the green tent. E.
and I went in and rolled up in our blankets on
the floor, which was distinctly hard. In the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
room Hendrickson was reading to Lydell the story
of Elisha and the Shunammite woman, rendered
apparently into easy English for children. His
accent was certainly most peculiar, and E., after
listening a bit, remarked, ‘A great many sibilants
in that language, aren’t there?’ being under the
impression that Hendrickson was sticking to his
native Swedish. I roared so that I feared they
would come and ask what was the matter, but
luckily they didn’t.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, the 19th.</i>—Rain nearly all night and
most of the day. E. and I got up about six
o’clock, roused by the men coming back with
clams, for which the tide suited. Last evening my
watch began to go in a feeble manner and made
three hours during the night. In the afternoon E.
and I played a curious form of cricket on the beach
with a wooden net-float for a ball, an axe-handle
for a bat, and two ice-axes for wickets. Having
smashed two balls, we had to desist, though not
before E. had defeated me with great slaughter.</p>

<p><i>Monday, the 20th.</i>—Wind still south-east, but
no ‘Alpha.’ We were getting thoroughly sick of
our enforced imprisonment in this place, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
there was literally nothing to do, the village being
hopelessly surrounded by bush, and so far from
the mountains that no hunting or exploring was
possible, for fear the ‘Alpha’ should arrive while
we were away. Tremendous rain all the afternoon,
which cleared as usual about six o’clock. The
wind, however, seemed rather more south-west.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, the 21st.</i>—Lovely morning at last, but
hardly any wind. My watch still kept going, but
only very slowly between the hours of seven and
eleven, something evidently clogging the works.
Ned’s canoe, the one we had at Icy Bay, was
going back to Juneau next day, which offered a
means of escape, but he was taking a cargo of
seal-oil! Shorty, however, wanted to go, but we
preferred to keep him. De Groff came to supper,
and we had some whist afterwards, keeping it up
till the extraordinarily late hour of half-past ten,
when he took his departure by the light of a lovely
full moon.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, the 22nd.</i>—Perfect weather again.
Shorty had sold the rifle he bought from W. to
Sub-chief George, and Finn E.’s to Frank, a friend
of Ned’s. This breach of the law rather annoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
us, as we naturally thought the men had purchased
the rifles to keep, but we saw no good in interfering,
now that the deed was done. Our four Indians
came over about breakfast-time to take E. salmon-spearing,
and reported that Ned had not taken his
departure last night, so I said I would go with
him and take Finn to look after me. H. then
proposed that I should take our Indians, who were
eating their heads off to no purpose, and Shorty
suggested that we might buy a canoe and all go
down together, so we went over to Yakutat to
make inquiries. De Groff admitted that all agreement
with him was over on the 20th, and seemed
to have but little hope of the ‘Alpha’s’ turning up
now, but believed that the ‘Leo,’ or even the
‘Pinta,’ would come for us. Canoes were to be
bought for a hundred and twenty or a hundred
and fifty dollars, but H. was rather unwilling to go
in one, so we came back at two o’clock for E.’s
opinion, but he had not returned.</p>

<p>We began boiling bacon, and started Finn on
a big batch of bread. E. came back at four with
a fair lot of fish; unable to quite settle, though
against the canoe idea on the whole, he and H.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
went over to Yakutat to decide and to fetch
Shorty, while Finn and I went on cooking. They
returned at 7.30, having concluded not to go, and
the Siwashes refused to come in the canoe unless
H. did, saying they had not made an agreement
with me but with him. As they were all
accustomed to canoes, and Matthew had done the
trip twice before, I do not think they were afraid
(except perhaps of hard work), but merely that
they found themselves in very comfortable quarters
at Yakutat, drawing full pay and doing very little
for it, and wished to prolong that happy state of
things as long as possible. Ned was willing to
take any number of passengers to Juneau for ten
dollars each, but after much discussion it was at
last settled that I should take Lyons, Shorty, and
Finn, and try to get Ned to go to Sitka; so I
went over about ten o’clock with the two former
and routed out Ned, who agreed to take us to
Sitka for eighty dollars, half down. As most of
the people in the Chief’s house were asleep, we
curled up <i>sub Jove frigido</i> on the stoop, and were
soon asleep.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">YAKUTAT TO SITKA</span></h2>

<p><i>Thursday, the 23rd.</i>—Up at sunrise, the blankets
dripping with dew. As the morning was perfectly
lovely, and the mountains quite clear, I roused De
Groff to photograph, and then we went over in the
big canoe to fetch Finn and our things, and said
good-bye to the other two and to the missionaries.
We then returned to the island and cooked our
breakfast on De Groff’s stove, who was rather sad
at our departure, but brightened up before we
went. We managed to purchase a little hard tack
and rice in the village, but could not get away till
after nine o’clock, as Ned, in his delight at the
prospect of such a lucrative voyage, was boozing
with a few select friends on ‘hoochinoo,’ a vile decoction
they distil from sugar, and was only got
away when about half-seas over. At 8.30 H. came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
across with a letter for his brother Alfred, and
went back just before our departure.</p>

<p>We pulled to Ocean Cape, which we reached
at eleven o’clock, and then set both sails ‘wing and
wing’ as the wind was dead aft though very light.
The result of Ned’s potations was that we gybed
with some frequency, and, apparently becoming
aware of this, he transferred the steering-lines to
his young brother Jack, who, with Ned’s wife and
another Indian named Frank, made up the crew,
and composed himself to sleep. We sailed steadily
on all day, keeping five or six miles from the shore,
which is here a low sandy beach on which the
Pacific surf continually breaks, so that it is always
difficult to land, and in bad weather becomes quite
impossible, and therefore this was the most dangerous
part of our canoe journey. At sunset we
were nearly opposite the western end of Dry Bay,
and as the wind died we pulled for a bit, but a
land breeze from the north then came, and though,
as it was on the beam, we were sure to make a lot
of leeway, we kept the sails up, and proceeded to
arrange ourselves as best we could for sleep. This
is not very easy in a canoe even when forty feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
long, as the seats and cross-pieces prevent any
extension movements of the body, but Ned’s bedding
was allotted to me, and nicely filled the space
aft of the stroke thwart. This canoe was fitted
with four oars and, <i>mirabile dictu</i>, a rudder with
yoke-lines, the only one I ever saw on a canoe, all
the others being steered by paddles. Wash-boards
had also been put on her for this ocean cruise, and
we had had to cut holes in these for the oars.</p>

<p><i>Friday, the 24th.</i>—Splendid weather, almost
too hot. At sunrise we had hardly cleared Dry
Bay, but were some ten or twelve miles from land.
About nine o’clock the west wind came again, but
it was very light, and our progress was slow in the
extreme. Swarms of little divers kept appearing
all round us, and in the afternoon, when all were
asleep but Ned and me, two small plover came on
board and stayed for some time. At three o’clock
the breeze died, and then a puff from the south-east
rather alarmed us, and made us pull in for
land, then about eight miles off, but it vanished
again, and we pulled steadily on till just at sundown
we reached the Indians’ regular camping-place,
about four miles north of Cape Fairweather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Though somewhat protected, the landing is
through surf, and we had accordingly to unload
the cargo, consisting of a few sea-otter skins and
rather over a ton of seal-oil in square boxes, and
then to pull up the canoe. We soon had a fire
going, and cooked some soup and salmon, the
former being much appreciated by Finn, who had
been more or less sea-sick all day and got terribly
chaffed by the Indians. The night was so fine that
we did not pitch the tent, but just rolled it round
us as we lay on the sand, with the roar of the surf
lulling us to sleep.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, the 25th.</i>—Ned called us at five
o’clock, and, after a hearty breakfast of fried
salmon and corn-meal mush, of which latter we
cooked a good quantity so as to be able to
eat it cold in the canoe during the day, we got
off at 7.30 with some difficulty, as the tide
was ebbing, and the canoe kept sticking as we
piled the stuff into her, and having to be moved
down a little further. I did not envy Frank,
who had to hold on to the stern of the canoe,
which was bow on to the shore, for about half-an-hour,
sometimes up to his shoulders in the icy surf,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
in order to keep her straight, and we were all more
or less wet by the time we got off. Our frying-pan,
which had long lost its handle, still had the remains
of the salmon in it, and, while Shorty was trying
to wash it in the sea, it slipped from his fingers and
vanished for ever. This was a terrible blow, as all
our bread was baked in it.</p>

<p>As we pulled to Cape Fairweather, clearing the
point at half-past eight, I was able to do a little
more to a sketch of Mount Fairweather, begun the
night before. It bears a curious resemblance to
Mount St. Elias, not only in its own shape, but also
in that of the mountains immediately adjacent,
having the same black ridge on the left, rising first
into a Hump and then into a Huxley, but without
the teeth on the left of the top of the latter, while
on the right is a mountain wonderfully like Cook.
A possible route from our last night’s camp for the
ascent of Mount Fairweather would be through the
bush to the glacier behind, along the course of the
stream running into the sea close to the camping-place;
then up the glacier for two easy days, or
even one fair one, according to the state of the ice,
and then right up the west arête; but the snow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
looked bad, and the rocks, though nowhere very
steep, seemed ominously smooth.</p>

<p>A fine wind, increasing every moment, now
sent us along at a grand pace, the water every now
and then surging through the oar-holes, which we
stopped as best we could by covering them with
paddles. About seven to ten miles north of our
camp is a very large glacier (the Grand Plateau?),
of which the centre, covered with moraine, comes
almost, if not quite, to the sea, while on either side
is a stream of pure white ice. St. Elias was visible
just over the point to the north of it, but we afterwards
kept too close to the land to ever see it
again, though it has been observed as far south as
the entrance to Salisbury Sound, a distance of <i>two
hundred and eighty miles</i>. As we got more to the
south we could see that Fairweather’s ‘Hump’ was
double-headed, while ‘Huxley’ looked very like
the Rothhorn as seen from the Riffel. The west
arête of Fairweather now seemed worse, there being
a level jagged piece like the ‘Crête du Coq’ on the
Matterhorn just before joining the main mass of
the mountain. The upper part of the easternmost
of the three southern arêtes looked feasible enough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
but the bottom was of precipitous dark-brown rock,
to all appearance very little broken. This arête
would be reached by the glacier which runs into
the northern arm of Lituya Bay.</p>

<p>The Indians now shouted out, ‘Schooner,
schooner!’ and we were much excited, intending,
if it should prove to be the ‘Alpha,’ to get some
tinned luxuries and our mails from her, but we
soon decided that it was only a canoe. We then
lost sight of it for a bit, but came suddenly on it
again, when it turned out to be only a floating
spruce, to the huge amusement of my crew.</p>

<p>With a real good wind we went flying along
finely, and passed the mouth of Lituya Bay at
eleven o’clock. The narrow entrance was quite
smooth, and we could easily have gone in. We
reached the Great Pacific Glacier at 2.30; this has
a sea-front of white ice a mile and a half long, but,
though great pieces are constantly breaking off,
there are no bergs, as the surf pounds them up
directly. The wind now began to slacken, and we
did not reach Astrolabe Point, near which are some
hot springs frequented by the Indians, till half-past
six, while at sunset the breeze disappeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
altogether. Ned, with whom we, as passengers, never
interfered in the management of his vessel, seemed
undecided whether to go on all night or not, but the
sunset had rather foreboded stormy weather, and
he eventually headed for land. We pulled and
paddled till ten o’clock, by which time it was quite
dark, but the Indians found a little harbour known
as Murphy’s Cove in a mysterious manner, and we
tumbled out over sharp rocks to a tiny sandbeach,
where we made a fire and had some coffee. Ned
pitched his tent, Frank and Jack sleeping in the
canoe, which was moored, while the rest of us lay
about anywhere in the long rough grass. By the
fire we found some porcupine quills, and there were
other signs of Indians having been there recently.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, the 26th.</i>—I woke the others at five;
the sky was grey and threatening, and the wind
seemed to be from the east. All our stores were
in a big rubber sack, the mouth of which had not
been tied up, and Jack, in getting it from the canoe,
managed to drop into the sea the bags which contained
the rice and oatmeal. We promptly made
porridge with the wet portion of the latter, and put
the rice near the fire to dry; it swelled rather, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
there was not much of it, and it all got eaten before
it went wrong. Ned’s big water-breaker had apparently
once contained seal-oil, and the taste consequently
imparted to the water was most loathsome,
so that we were always careful to empty it out and
fill it afresh before starting. For this purpose I
went to a little stream only a yard or two wide,
which ran into the corner of the harbour, and found
it perfectly choked with salmon; in the first pool,
which was about as big as a large hip-bath, were
between twenty and thirty, varying from ten to
twenty-five pounds in weight. In the stream and
on the edges were so many dead and dying ones,
that the water did not look tempting, but it was
the best that could be had.</p>

<p>We got off at 7.30, passing out by the canoe
entrance, where we had tried to come in the night
before, but had found the tide too low. We only
just cleared the bar now by those of the men who
had gum-boots on getting into the water and
shoving. We pulled out through small islets of
rock, but as we got to sea a strong squally east
wind came on, and we had to take shelter at the
Indians’ usual landing-place at Cape Spencer itself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
after going about five miles. The cape is rather
like a four-or five-pronged fork, long promontories
of rock running out, with very narrow bays between.
We tried the most sheltered of these, but
found too little water at the entrance, and had to
go on to the next, which was a good deal more
exposed.</p>

<p>We got ashore at half-past nine, and as it was
beginning to rain, we pitched our tent on the
shingle, after which I went with Ned to the river,
which was about a quarter of a mile off and ran
into the bay that we had first tried to enter. It
was a nice clear stream from ten to twenty yards
wide, and full of salmon which fled before us,
raising a great wave in the water. He speared ten
in about twenty minutes, but they were all dogs
but two. A great argument is at present raging
in America as to whether these dogs, which have
white flesh, are spent salmon or not; personally, I
do not think they are, as at the mouth of this river
there was a considerable fall at low water, and I
saw there the doggiest of dogs waiting for the tide
to come up so that they might ascend the river.
When I returned Shorty and Lyons were asleep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
but Finn cooked me some lunch. He told me that
the Tlinkits make hoolachan oil by stacking the
fish in a canoe till they are rotten, they then add a
little water to keep the canoe from burning, and
pile heated rocks on the mass, drawing off the oil
through a plug-hole at the bottom.</p>

<p>In the afternoon it rained off and on, and the
wind rather went down, but it would have been
very bad in Cross Sound, and, though I think we
might have got over, it would have been very risky
to try, as we might so easily have been blown out
to sea. We now made the discovery that our
bacon had gone rancid and was quite uneatable,
though the grease could be used for cooking.
Though nothing would induce the white men to
touch it, I had found that boiled salmon-roe, if
well cleaned, was most excellent, so I prepared a
piece and laid it on a stone, but, when I turned
round a few minutes later, I saw a great raven
flying off with it. I got some more later, as Finn
and the Indians went to the river and speared and
shot a lot of fish, only bringing back the good
ones. They speared a salmon-trout of five or six
pounds, but they threw each fish on the bank as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
they got it, to be picked up on the way down, and
somehow missed this one, so I never saw it. About
four o’clock the sun came out; we seemed to be on
the edge of the bad weather, as to the north and
west it was fine and clear, but thick and grey to
the south, towards which quarter our cove faced.
In the evening it turned grey again and began to
rain, so, after a supper of rice soup and boiled fish,
we turned in early.</p>

<p><i>Monday, the 27th.</i>—There was a lot of rain in
the night, and more wind, so that the Indians had
to unload and pull up the canoe, in which Ned was
sleeping. In the morning there was plenty of blue
sky to the north, but the same strong east wind
kept us prisoners. At breakfast our scanty store
of sugar came to an end. This didn’t affect me
much, but the men were grieved at having to eat
their porridge plain. The Siwashes now discovered
frogs in the vegetation where they had pitched
their tent. They are very superstitious about these
reptiles, whose image often appears on their totem-poles,
and accordingly moved their tent down to
ours, though at the same time they seemed to consider
it rather a good joke. I borrowed Finn’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
gum-boots and went up the river with the spear,
which had no barb, so that it was not very easy to
secure the fish when struck. The Indians used to
flip them out on to the bank, but my wrists were
not strong enough for that with a thick twelve-foot
pole, and I had to hold my captive down till I
could shorten the spear, so sundry escaped, but I
got eight or ten, following the river up for about a
mile to where it got wider and shallower, and some
Indians had at one time constructed a barrier and
trap, now very dilapidated, with twigs and branches.</p>

<p>When I returned I found that Ned’s wife had
washed the blacking off her face with surprising
results. I had sat at her feet for three days in the
canoe under the impression that she was a hideous
creature of about thirty, but now she appeared to
be about seventeen, and really quite good-looking,
being as fair as most Italians. Ned was himself a
smart-looking fellow, and they made a handsome
pair, though, like nearly all these coast Indians,
their legs were deformed from the continual canoe
life. All the women of these parts, and a good
many of the men, black their faces in summer,
partly to preserve the complexion, and partly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
keep off mosquitoes. They used to employ a
mixture of soot and seal-oil, but now that the
advance of civilisation has introduced them to
blacking, they much prefer that. My watch now
took to going all right again, the fine glacier mud
apparently dropping out as it dried.</p>

<p>At noon it began to rain steadily and kept on
till five, when it kindly left off for a little, so we
turned out and had supper. In spite of the rain,
Finn had managed to bake some sour-dough bread
in our tin plates, and he persuaded it to rise by
covering it with our warm blankets. Though a
good deal burnt in baking, it was quite excellent,
and I particularly appreciated it as being the only
crusty bread we ever had, but the men didn’t care
for it. A crusty loaf is always an abomination to
an American, and our preference for the outside
always surprised our men. It soon began to rain
again, so we turned in at seven, and lay in bed
talking. Lyons had been in France and Germany
as a child, but did not remember much about his
journey.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, the 28th.</i>—In the middle of the night
we heard the Indians making a great noise and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
roaring with laughter, and, on one of the men going
out to inquire, we found that the little lake behind
had been so swollen by the continued rain, that a
stream had burst up through the shingle in the
middle of their tent and swamped them out. Like
the episode of the frogs, they seemed to consider
it an excellent joke, though I should have been
exceedingly annoyed had I had to move tent and
blankets under pouring rain in the dark. But the
coast Indian is a cheerful personage, and quite
unlike his statelier cousin of the plains. The
question of his relationship to Japan I leave to
wiser heads than mine.</p>

<p>It rained nearly all night, and the wind was
much stronger. We lay in bed till 8.30, when
Shorty made us some corn-meal cakes, as the oatmeal
was finished. It went on raining hard, and
we lay in the tent, the wet coming through freely
on to our blankets, till half-past three, when it
began to clear and the sun came partly out. It
soon went in again, but the wind had gone round to
the south-west, so we had hope for the morrow.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, the 29th.</i>—None of us except Finn
were able to sleep much, owing partly to so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
lying in the tent, and partly to the influx of insect
life which had appeared on the cessation of the
rain. Small black spiders which bit like anything,
swarms of mosquitoes, and the biggest sand-fleas
I ever saw,—they kept up such a pop-popping
all night by jumping against the tent, that we
thought it was raining when it was really quite
fine.</p>

<p>We were up at five and off by 6.30, when we
pulled east for an hour round the point into Cross
Sound. Here we found a dense fog and an icy-cold
north-east wind coming off the glacier in Taylor’s
Bay, so we set sail and ran across the Sound in an
hour and twenty minutes to Lisianski Channel,
between Tchitchagoff and Jacobi Islands. This
channel is extremely narrow, and we sailed down
it with a light breeze for three hours, seeing
quantities of white-headed eagles on the trees.
We then reached the corner where the strait turns
sharp to the west, and landed for about an hour.
We found here a skull on the beach, about which
Shorty and Finn had an argument which culminated
in the former betting twenty dollars to Finn’s
watch on its being a deer’s head; but he lost, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Ned, whom they appointed umpire, pronounced it
to be that of a seal.</p>

<p>We went on again at one o’clock, pulling and
paddling steadily against the tide, and had almost
reached the open sea at 4.30, when the tide turned
and a good north-west wind sprang up. We found
a heavyish sea outside still running up from the
south-east, but the wind drove us through it at a
great pace, and we passed Cape Edwardes at about
sunset. We then got in among the fringe of small
islands, and landed at nine o’clock some six miles
further on in a little harbour which took some
finding in the dark. We landed over some rather
broken rocks, and Lyons was much taken aback at
finding himself at the edge of what seemed in the
blackness of the night to be a bottomless chasm,
though in the morning it proved to be only about
four feet deep. We lit a fire and prepared some
pea-soup, after consuming which we curled up on
the moss under the trees, the men rolling up in the
tent, while I had blankets enough to take a nook
apart. The night was lovely and the starlight
most brilliant.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, the 30th.</i>—A beautiful morning. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
woke the rest at five, and after some coffee and
corn-meal mush we got off at 6.30 and rowed to
the end of the islands, by which time it was half-past
nine, and the west wind came again according
to custom. About this period I recognised the
conical top of Mount Edgcumbe, and pointed it
out to Finn, who had not been in these parts before.
We reached the entrance of Salisbury Sound at
noon, and ate our one precious tin of corned beef,
which we had saved so carefully. We flew down
the Sound at a great pace through crowds of porpoises,
at which the men tried several futile shots.
At one o’clock we rounded the corner opposite
Peril Straits, and saw a vessel coming towards us,
which we at first expected would be the ‘Idaho,’
which, on account of the crowd of tourists, had
been doing some supplementary trips to those of
the ‘Ancon’ and ‘Elder,’ but as she got nearer we
recognised the ‘Pinta.’ Since we were going about
nine knots we did not want to waste any of our
wind, and merely ran past, exchanging salutes.</p>

<p>About three o’clock the wind began to die
away, and at four, just after we had passed St.
John the Baptist’s Bay, we had to take to the oars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and, pulling on steadily at a good pace, came in
sight of Sitka at about seven, when I sent my
previously untouched whisky-flask round, and half
an hour later we were ordering a sumptuous supper
of clam-soup, halibut, and venison, while half the
population were crowding round to hear our tale.
I was just in time to secure the ‘Leo,’ a steam
schooner of about fifty tons, which would otherwise
have sailed at midnight for Port Townsend, and
for four hundred dollars her owner consented to go
up to Yakutat and fetch the others.</p>

<p>H. said they were wild with delight when they
saw her round the point three days later, but after
all, I had the best of it, for they encountered a
fearful south-east gale, and, after springing a bad
leak, had to run back to Yakutat, where they
beached and repaired her, and did not reach Sitka
till the 17th of September.</p>

<p>Our expedition was a failure, chiefly from the
want of trained men to convey camping material
to a great height, and the next party would do
well to take a couple of Swiss porters. We were
wonderfully favoured by the weather, and were
most fortunate in that, out of the party of fourteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
who went inland, the only casualty was Shorty’s
strain, and that did not occur till we had commenced
the return journey.</p>

<p>But, should any one think of organising an
expedition for climbing in the St. Elias Alps, I
would strongly advise him to turn his attention
to Mounts Fairweather and Crillon. For these
Lituya Bay offers a first-rate starting point, since
there is in its recesses ample anchorage even for
men-of-war, while the peaks are probably not
more than fifteen miles away, and sundry expeditions
of great merit might be made.</p>

<p>The height of Mount St. Elias suffered a rude
onslaught at the hands of a party of American
surveyors in 1890, but I feel tolerably sure in my
own mind that the old height of nineteen thousand
feet is the more correct one, for the following
reasons. Firstly, the figures establishing the
highest point reached as 11,375 feet were carefully
worked out; previous observations had given the
height of the crater’s rim as 7,500 feet; and the
times taken by the other three, a very fast party,
correspond very fairly, so that we may assume this
height to be fairly exact. At this point they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
above the col, but not as high as Haydon Peak,
and therefore probably about a thousand feet above
the col. Now, from Yakutat it is clear at once
that this col is barely half-way up the mountain.
Secondly, as I went down the coast in the canoe
the weather was absolutely perfect, and Mount St.
Elias clearly in view till the third morning, when
we lost it by getting behind Cape Fairweather. I
can clearly recollect how, as we were pulling in to
the landing-place north of Cape Fairweather on
the second evening, the peak stood up clear and
sharp against the sunset sky, with at least a third
of its bulk above the horizon. The mountain had
never been out of sight, and the sun was not
shining on the snows, so I do not think any
assistance was gained from refraction. As Cape
Fairweather is distant 150 miles from Mount St.
Elias, this would again make the peak about
20,000 feet high. Milmore, the steward of the
‘Pinta,’ who knew the appearance of the mountain
well, assured me that, on their voyage down from
Yakutat in 1886, it was in sight as far south as
Salisbury Sound; but I cannot help thinking some
mistake was made between it and perhaps Crillon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
However, other people assured me they had seen
it when off Cross Sound.</p>

<p>With reference to the supposed volcanic origin
of the mountain, I think the main mass is certainly
not volcanic; but I brought home from the moraine
of the Tyndall Glacier two or three pieces of red
amygdaloid lava, which I believe came from the
Red Hills just south of the ‘crater,’ so that, possibly,
this crater may be due, after all, to volcanic
forces.</p>

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
